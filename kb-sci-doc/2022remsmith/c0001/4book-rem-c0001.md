DIPOLE TRANSFORMER GENERATOR DESCRIPTION

TECHNICAL FIELD:

The Invention relates to loaded Dipole Antenna Systems and their Electromagnetic radiation. When used as a transformer with an appropriate energy collector system it becomes a transformer generator. The invention collects and converts energy which, with conventional devices, is radiated and wasted.

技术领域：

本发明涉及负载偶极天线系统及其电磁辐射。当用作具有适当能量收集系统的变压器时，它就变成了变压器发电机。本发明收集和转换能量，这些能量与传统设备一起被辐射和浪费。

BACKGROUND ART:

An International search of Patent Databases for closely related methods did not reveal any prior Art with an Interest in conserving radiated and wasted mag¬netic waves as useful energy.

背景艺术：

在国际专利数据库中搜索密切相关的方法，没有发现任何对将辐射和浪费的电磁波作为有用能量感兴趣的现有技术。

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION:

The Invention is a new and useful departure from transformer generator construction, such that radiated and wasted magnetic energy changes into useful electrical energy.  Gauss Meters show that much energy from conventional electromagnetic devices is radiated back into the ambient background and wasted. In the case of conventional transformer generators, a radical change in the physical construction, allows better access to the energy available. It is found that creating a dipole and Inserting capacitor plates at right angle to the current flow, allows magnetic waves to change back to useful electrical (coulombs) energy. Magnetic waves passing through the capacitor plates do not degrade and the full impact of the available energy is accessed. One, or many sets of capacitor plates, may be used as desired. Each set of plates makes an exact copy of the full force and effect of the energy present in the magnetic waves.  The originating source is not depleted or degraded as is common in conventional transformers.

发明公开：

本发明是对变压器发电机结构的一种新的有用的偏离，使得辐射和浪费的磁能转化为有用的电能。高斯计显示，传统电磁设备的大量能量被辐射回环境背景并被浪费。就传统的变压器发电机而言，物理结构的根本性改变可以更好地获取可用的能源。研究发现，创建偶极子并以与电流成直角的方式插入电容器板，可以使磁波变回有用的电能（库仑）。穿过电容器板的磁波不会退化，并且可以获得可用能量的全部影响。根据需要，可以使用一组或多组电容器极板。每组板都精确地复制了磁波中存在的能量的全部力和效应。原始电源不会像传统变压器中常见的那样耗尽或退化。

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:

The Dipole at right angle allows the magnetic flux surrounding it to intercept the capacitor plate, or plates, at right angles. The electrons present are spun in such a way that the electrical component of the electrons is collected by the capacitor plates.  Essential parts are the South and North component of an active Dipole. Examples presented here, exist as fully functional prototypes, and were engineer constructed and fully tested for utility by the Inventor. Corresponding parts are utilized in each of the three examples as shown in the Drawings.
