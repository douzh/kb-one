ELECTRICAL PRINCIPLES: TERMINOLOGY & SAFETY

The use of electricity is so commonplace that most people assume that it will always be
available on demand. To fully realize our dependence upon electricity, consider the ways in
which electricity is being used each day in the home, on the farm and the ranch. Electricity is
doing more to increase work efficiency and promote enjoyable living than any other single
factor. The use of electricity has grown to the extent that an increasing portion of the home or
business budget, is used in paying for this source of energy.

1. Definition of Electricity

Electricity can be defined in several ways. The layman defines electricity as a source of energy
that can be converted to light, heat, or power. Electrical Engineers define electricity as a
movement of electrons caused by electrical pressure or voltage. The amount of energy
produced depends on the number of electrons in motion.

2. The Manufacture and Distribution of Electricity

Electricity is produced from generators that are run by water, steam, or internal combustion
engines. If water is used as a source of power to turn generators, it is referred to as
hydroelectric generation. There are a number of this type located in areas where huge dams
have been built across large streams.

Steam is used as a source of power for generating much of today's electricity. Water is heated to
a high temperature, and the steam pressure is used to turn turbines which generate electricity.
These are referred to as thermal-powered generators. Fuels used to heat the water are coal,
natural gas, and/or fuel oil.

Generators at the power plant generate from 13,800 to 22,000 volts of electricity. From the
power plant, electricity is carried to a step-up sub-station which, through the use of
transformers, increases the voltage from 69,000 to 750,000 volts. This increase in voltage is
necessary for the efficient transmission of electricity over long distances. From the step-up substation, the electricity is carried on transmission lines to a step-down sub-station which reduces
the voltage to 7,200 to 14,000 volts for distribution to rural and city areas.

Transformers at the business or residence reduce the voltage to 120 or 240 volts to supply the
meter of the customer:

3. Common Electrical Terms

In order to work safely and efficiently with electricity and have the ability to converse on the
subject, the following terms should be understood:

Ampere (Amp) - A measurement in units of the rate of flow of electrical current. This may be
compared with the rate of flow of water in gallons per minute. Example: A 60-watt
incandescent lamp on a 120V circuit would pull 1/2 ampere of electricity (60 divided by 120 =
0.5 or 1/2, Formula: Amperes = Watts / Volts

Volt (V) - A unit of measure of electrical pressure. A given electrical pressure (V) causes a
given amount of electrical current (Amps) to flow through a load of given resistance. Voltage
may be compared to water pressure in pounds per square inch in a water system. Common
service voltages are 120 volts for lighting and small appliance circuits and 240 volts for
heating, air conditioning, and large equipment circuits.

Watt (W) - A unit of measure of electrical power. When applied to electrical equipment, it is
the rate that electrical energy is transformed into some other form of energy such as light. Watts
may be compared to the work done by water in washing a car. (Formula: Volts x Amps = Watts)

Kilowatt (KW) - A unit of measurement used in computing the amount of electrical energy
used. Kilowatts are determined by dividing the number of watts by 1000 as 1 kilowatt = 1,000
watts.

Kilowatt-Hour (KWH) - A measure of electricity in terms of power in kilowatts and time in
hours. One KWH is 1000 watts used for one hour. Alternating Current (A.C.) - Electrical
current that alternates or changes direction several times per second. The direction currentmoves depends on the direction in which the voltage forces it.

Cycle - The flow of electricity in one direction, the reverse flow of electricity in the other
direction, and the start of the flow back in the other direction. The cycles per second are
regulated by the power supplier and are usually 60 in America. Most electric clocks are built to
operate on the mains frequency. More or fewer cycles per second would cause mains-operated
clocks to gain or lose time. The present practice is to use the term Hertz (Hz) rather than
"cycles per second".

Direct Current (D.C.) - Electrical current flowing in one direction. Example: electrical circuits
in automobiles and tractors.

Transformer - A device used to increase or decrease voltage.

![](assets/c0008-04.png)

Single Phase - The most common type of electrical service or power available to consumers.
One transformer is used between the distribution line and the meter. Usually three wires, two
"hot" and one neutral, are installed to provide 120V and 240V single-phase service. Singlephase service may also be supplied with a three-phase service.

Three-Phase - This type of service is designed especially for large electrical loads. It is a more
expensive installation due to three wires and three transformers being required. The important
advantage of three-phase power is that the total electrical load is divided among the three
phases, consequently, the wire and transformers can be smaller. Other advantages exist in the
design of three-phase motors.

Short Circuit - A direct connection (before current flows through an appliance) between two
"hot" wires, between a "hot" and neutral wire, or between a "hot" wire and ground.

Voltage Drop - A reduction of current between the power supply and the load. Due to
resistance, there will be a loss of voltage any time electricity flows through a conductor (wire).

Factors that influence voltage drop are size of wire, length of wire, and the number of amps
flowing. A drop in voltage may cause a loss of heat, light, or the full power output of a motor. It
could cause motor burn-out unless the motor is properly protected (time-delay fuse).

Fuse - A device used to protect circuits from an overload of current.

Circuit Breaker - A device used to protect circuits from an overload of current. May be
manually reset.

Time-Delay Fuse - A fuse with the ability to carry an overload of current for a short duration
without disengaging the contacts or melting the fuse link.

Horsepower (hp) - A unit of mechanical power equal to 746 watts of electrical power
(assuming 74.6% electric motor efficiency). Motors of one horsepower and above are rated at
1000 watts per hp while motors below one horsepower are rated at 1,200 watts per hp.

Conductor - The wire used to carry electricity (typically, copper or aluminum). Copper and
aluminum should not be spliced together due to their incompatibility resulting in deterioration
and oxidation.

Insulator - A material which will not conduct electricity and is usually made of glass, Bakelite,
porcelain, rubber, or thermo-plastic.

"Hot" Wire - A current-carrying conductor under electrical pressure and connected to a fuse or
circuit breaker at the distribution panel. (Color Code: usually black or red)

Neutral Wire - A current-carrying conductor not under electrical pressure and connected to the
neutral bar at the distribution panel. (Color Code: usually white)

Grounding - The connection of the neutral part of the electrical system to the earth to reduce
the possibility of damage from lightning and the connection of electrical equipment housings to
the earth to minimize the danger from electrical shock. (Color Code: Can be green or bare
wire).

Underwriters' Laboratory (U.L.) - An American national organization which tests all types of
wiring materials and electrical devices to insure that they meet minimum standards for safetyand quality.

National Electric Code (N.E.C.) - Regulations approved by the National Board of Fire
Underwriters primarily for safety in electrical wiring installations. All wiring should meet the
requirements of the national as well as the local code.

4. Computing Electrical Energy Use and Cost

If an estimate of cost for electricity used is desired, the name plate data on appliances and
equipment and an estimate of operating time may be used. The following formulas should be
used for determining watts, amps, volts, watt-hours, kilowatt-hours, and cost.

    Watts = Volts x Amperes
    Amperes = Watts / Volts
    Volts = Watts / Amperes
    Watt-Hours = Watts x Hours of operation
    Kilowatt-Hours = Watt-Hours / 1000
    Cost = Kilowatt-Hours x Local Rate per Kilowatt-Hour (or per "Unit")

Example:

Local electricity rate per Kilowatt-Hour: 8 cents

Equipment plate data: 120 Volts 5 Amps

Monthly hours of operation: 10

1. Watts = Volts x Amperes, so Watts = 120 x 5 = 600 watts
2. Watt-Hours = 600 x 10 = 6,000 watt-hours
3. Kilowatt-Hours = 5,000 / 1,000 = 6 kilowatt-hours (or 6 Units)
4. Cost = 6 x 8 = 48 cents
5. Electrical Circuits An Electrical Circuit is a completed path through which electricity
flows. Insulated conductors (wires) provide the path for the flow of electricity. A water system
and an electrical circuit are similar in many respects. Water flows through pipes and is
measured in gallons per minute, and electricity flows through conductors and is measured in
amperes. A simple circuit is shown here:

![](assets/c0008-05.png)

A circuit includes a "hot" wire (red or black) carrying current from the source through a switch,circuit protector (fuse or circuit-breaker), and an appliance. The neutral wire (white) conducts
the current from the appliance to the source (ground).

There arc two methods for connecting devices in a circuit - "in series" or "in parallel". In a
series circuit, all of the current must flow through each device in the circuit. Removing any one
of the devices in a series circuit will stop the flow of current. In parallel circuits, the load
(lights or appliances) are connected between the two wires of the circuit providing an
independent path for the flow of current, and removing a lamp has no effect on the other lamps
in the circuit.

Switches, fuses, and circuit breakers are always connected in series. In most cases, except for
some Christmas tree lights, appliances and lights are connected in parallel.

6. 120 Volt and 240 Volt Circuits

The 120V circuit has one "hot" and one neutral wire, with the switch and circuit protector in
the hot line. The neutral wire from the appliance is connected to the neutral bar in the fuse or
breaker box. For safety, the neutral wire should never be broken or interrupted with a switch or
fuse.

![](assets/c0008-07.png)

The voltage in a 120V circuit is measured with a voltmeter with one lead on the hot terminal
and the other lead on the neutral bar. The number of amperes flowing may be measured with a
clamp-on ammeter by encircling the hot or neutral wire with the jaws of the ammeter.

![](assets/c0008-08.png)

The 240V circuit has two hot wires and one safety-ground wire. Switches and fuses are
installed in the hot lines. The two hot wires arc necessary for the operation of 240V welders
and motors. The safety-ground wire, connected to the metal frame of the equipment or motor
and to the neutral bar, does not carry current unless a "short" develops in the motor or welder.
If a short should occur, one of the circuit protectors will burn-out or open, thus opening the
circuit.

![](assets/c0008-09.png)

The voltage on a 240V circuit is measured by fastening a lead on the voltmeter to each of the
hot wires. Voltage between either hot terminal and the neutral bar will be one-half of the
voltage between the two hot wires. The number of amperes flowing can be measured by
clamping an ammeter around either of the hot wires.

7. Safety Grounding of Electrical Equipment

Refer back, to the 240V circuit and note the ground wire from the metal frame to the neutral
bar. The following illustration shows proper safety grounding when operating a drill in a 120V
circuit. The safety-ground wire may be bare, but a three-wire cable is recommended. Safetyground wire in three-wire cable is usually green in color. A current-carrying neutral wire should
never be used for a safety-ground. Likewise, a safety-ground wire should never be used as a
current-carrying hot or neutral wire

![](assets/c0008-10.png)

Using grounded receptacles and a safety-ground on all circuits will allow the safety-grounding
of appliances when they are plugged into the outlet. An adapter must be used to properly
ground appliances connected to receptacles which are not safety-grounded. If an adapter is
used, the green pigtail wire must be connected to a known ground to give protection fromelectrical shock should a short-circuit occur.

![](assets/c0008-11.png)

A test lamp can be used to check a circuit completed between a "hot" wire and a neutral wire.
Use the test lamp to check appliances for shorts. With the appliance plugged into an outlet,
touch the appliance frame with one lead of the test lamp while the other lead of the test lamp is
grounded to a water or gas pipe. If the test light does not burn, reverse the appliance plug and
check with the test lamp again. If the light burns, a short exists (the hot wire is touching the
frame of the appliance). Unplug the appliance and repair or discard it.

8. Electrical Circuit Protection

Electrical circuits should be protected from an overload of amperes. Too many amperes
flowing through an unprotected circuit will generate heat, which will deteriorate or melt the
insulation and possibly cause a fire. The number of amperes that a given conductor can safely
carry, depends upon the kind and size of wire, type of insulation, length of run in feet, and the
type of installation. Charts are available in reference texts giving allowable current-carrying
capabilities of various conductors.

The four types of circuit protection are: common fuses, fusetrons (time-delay), fustats (twopart time-delay), and circuit-breakers. Fuses are of two basic types: plug, and cartridge.
Common fuses contain a link made from a low-temperature melting alloy which is designed to
carry current up to the rating of the fuse. Current higher than the amperage rating causes the
link to heat above it's melting point. When the fuse "blows", the link melts and opens the
circuit.

![](assets/c0008-12.png)

Fusetrons (time-delay fuses) are made to carry a temporary overload, such as the overload
caused by the starting of an electric motor. The fuse, however, still provides protection for thecircuit, and a short-circuit will melt the fuse link. If a common fuse is used, the fuse link will
melt every time an electric motor starts. The use of a larger ampere common fuse will prevent
the "blow" resulting from the temporary overload, but will not provide protection for the motor
or the circuit.
