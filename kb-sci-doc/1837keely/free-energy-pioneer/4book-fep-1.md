## 以太发现者约翰·基利早期生活

Discoverer of the Ether The Early Life of John Keely

"If all, or even one-half, of what is reported of the Keely Motor is true, the world is on the eve of the most tremendous revolution it has had since it began to revolve at all...."

The Evening Bulletin, July 8, 1875

“如果基利发动机报道的所有内容，甚至一半都是真的，那么世界将迎来自其开始运转以来最重大的革命......” 《晚间公告》，1875年7月8日

"Let a note be struck on an instrument, and the faintest sound produces an eternal echo. A disturbance is created on the invisible waves of the shoreless ocean of space, and the vibration is never wholly lost. Its energy being once carried from the world of matter into the immaterial world will live forever. "

H.P. Blavatsky, Isis Unveiled, 1877

“在一个乐器上敲响一声音符，即使是微弱的声音也会产生永恒的回音。在空间无尽的海洋上，无形波浪上产生了扰动，而这种振动永远不会完全消失。一旦其能量从物质世界带入了非物质世界，它将永生。” ——H.P.布拉瓦茨基，《揭示的伊西斯》，1877年

One of the most enigmatic persons in the history of free-energy research is inventor John Ernest Worrell Keely. He stood at the very base of the history of freeenergy research, and he possibly made the most important discovery of all time. Not only are the principles of the new form of energy that he claimed to have discovered
still not completely understood, but almost all of his incredible machines and inventions are now lost.

有史以来自由能研究史上最神秘的人物之一是发明家约翰·欧内斯特·沃雷尔·基利。他站在自由能研究史的最底层，可能做出了有史以来最重要的发现。他声称发现的新形式的能量原理仍不完全理解，几乎所有他的不可思议的机器和发明现在都已失去。

John Worrell Keely was bora September 3, 1837, either in Philadelphia in a twostory frame house that stood on the corner of Jacoby and Cherry Streets, or in the old town of Chester, Pennsylvania.1 Sometimes his birthyear is given as 1827. Keely was twice married, the second time in 1887, but left no children. His first wife and his only child died many years before his death. Of his second wife, only her name, Anna Keely, is known. Keely died in the same city on November 18, 1898, and he was buried in the West Laurel Hill Cemetery, 1305 Arch Street, Philadelphia. He has plot number 313 in the River Section. His grave is unmarked. A hard maple tree stands over the plot, which is covered with ivy vines.

约翰·沃雷尔·基利出生于1837年9月3日，出生地可能是宾夕法尼亚州的费城，在雅各比街和樱桃街的拐角处有一座两层楼的木制房屋，或者是在切斯特市的旧城区。有时他的出生年份被给出为1827年。基利结了两次婚，第二次婚姻是在1887年，但他没有孩子。他的第一任妻子和唯一的孩子在他去世多年前就已经去世了。关于他的第二任妻子，只知道她的名字是安娜·基利。基利死于1898年11月18日的同一座城市，被埋葬在费城的西劳雷尔山公墓（1305 Arch Street）中，他在River Section有着313号坟墓。他的墓地没有被标记，上面长有一棵硬枫树和常春藤藤蔓。

The parents of Keely's mother were of English and Swedish descent and his father's parents were of German and French descent. His father was an iron worker and it is alleged that his paternal grandfather was the German composer, Ernst, who led the Baden-Baden orchestra in his day.

基利的母亲的父母是英国和瑞典血统，而他父亲的父母是德国和法国血统。他的父亲是一名铁工，据称他的祖父是德国作曲家欧内斯特，曾在他那个时代带领巴登-巴登管弦乐团。

Keely had one brother, a J.A. Keely. Since he was orphaned in early childhood, they were probably separated early. Keely lost his parents in his infancy, his mother never recovering from his birth, and his father dying before he was three years old. After his father died, he came to live with his grandmother and an aunt, but his aunt died before he was sixteen, and his grandmother died a year later. Thus, Keely was thrown early upon his own resources. His educational opportunities were limited to the city schools of Philadelphia, which he left at the age of 12.

基利有一个兄弟，名叫J.A.基利。由于他在幼年时失去了父母，他们可能很早就分开了。基利在婴儿时期失去了父母，他的母亲从他的出生中没有恢复过来，他的父亲在他三岁前去世。在他的父亲去世后，他来到了祖母和一个姑妈的家中生活，但他的姑妈在他十六岁之前去世，他的祖母一年后去世。因此，基利早期就要靠自己的力量生存。他的教育机会仅限于费城市的学校，他在12岁离开了学校。

It is also claimed that he went to live with his grandfather, the German composer, who was unable to do much for him. After he left school, he was apprenticed to the carpenter's trade. Keely, then 12 years old, allegedly worked at this trade until 1872.

还有人声称他去住在他祖父家，祖父是一位德国作曲家，但他为他做了很少的事情。离开学校后，他成为一名木匠学徒。据称，当时12岁的基利一直从事这个行业，直到1872年。

Somewhere in these early years, Keely made his astonishing discovery and decided to follow that road. Contemporary sources have their own, sometimes contradictory, versions of how this happened. The nucleus of these tales is that Keely had his moment of illumination while observing peculiar effects of sound on certain
objects.

在这些早年，基利做出了惊人的发现，并决定走这条路。当代的资料对于这是如何发生也有自己的版本，有时候是相互矛盾的。这些故事的核心是，基利在观察音响对某些物体的特殊影响时，有了他的启示时刻。

Keely himself claimed that in his childhood he started his research, leading him to the discovery that would haunt him for the rest of his life: "Before I had reached my tenth year, researching in the realm of acoustic physics had a perfect fascination for me; my whole organism seemed attuned as if it were a harp of a thousand strings; set for the reception of all the conditions associated with sound force as a controlling medium, positive and negative; and with an intensity of enjoyment not to be described."

基利本人声称，在他的童年时期就开始了他的研究，最终导致了他一生中的发现：“在我还不到十岁时，探究声学物理学对我来说具有完美的吸引力；我的整个有机体似乎被调整成了一个拥有千条琴弦的竖琴，以接收声音能量作为控制介质的一切条件，包括正面和负面；并且带有无法描述的强烈愉悦感。”

But while he was drawn to this line of research before he was 10 years of age, an incident several years later set him on the course that he decided to follow: "...the first manifestation of which to me when I was twelve years old drew my attention to the channels in which I have since worked..."

在不到十岁时，基利就被吸引到这条研究领域，但是几年后的一件事情让他走上了自己决定要追随的道路：“......当我十二岁时，它们对我产生了第一个表现，引起了我的注意，从那时起我就在这些领域中工作......”

Keely never told what that manifestation, incident or discovery exactly was, although elsewhere a poetic picture is presented of a young Keely who "held the seashells to his ear as he walked the shore and noted that no two gave forth the same tone...," with which his work of discovery commenced.

基利从未透露那个表现、事件或者发现的具体内容，尽管在其他地方，有一幅诗意的画面呈现出一个年轻的基利，“在他漫步海岸线时，他将贝壳放在耳边，注意到没有两个贝壳发出相同的声音......”，这就是他探索发现的起点。

Since he never explained the nature of this incident, it was simply written by another that, "...since he was ten years of age [Keely] has been interested in the study of tones and resonances; of those rapid and incessant vibrations which underlie all we see in the world around us, and to which all the energies of the acting universe are primarily due. It is this study which he still continues, and the power which he has developed is claimed to come from a control of these vibrations...."

由于他从未解释这个事件的本质，因此另一个人简单地写道："......自十岁起 [基利] 就对音调和共鸣的研究感兴趣；对那些快速而不间断的振动感兴趣，它们构成了我们看到的世界的基础，以及所有活跃在宇宙中的能量的原始来源。正是这项研究他仍在继续，他所开发的能量据称来自对这些振动的控制......"

And elsewhere it is confirmed that Keely not only was a "poor lad reared in obscurity and privation, in early childhood drawn to these unique researches.. but that "from his earliest recollection...was drawn to the study of sound as relating to force, and commenced his first systematic investigation when hardly 10 years of age, making his first encouraging discovery at thirteen. As a child he noticed how powerfully windows were often agitated by the heavy tones of an organ, and this led him to place various objects about the room, suspending glass dishes, etc., and then watching for any effect that might be produced by the various chords he was able to secure by the combination of different tones. He soon found that certain chords invariably resulted in the forcible agitation of objects at a distance."

在其他地方确实确认了基利不仅是“在黑暗和贫困中长大的可怜孩子，从幼年时期开始就被这些独特的研究所吸引……”，而且“从他最早的记忆开始……他就被声音与力量的关系所吸引，并在他还没有10岁的时候开始了他的第一次系统调查，13岁时取得了鼓舞人心的首次发现。作为一个孩子，他注意到管风琴底音常常会使窗户强烈震动，这促使他在房间里放置各种物体，悬挂玻璃碗等，然后观察通过不同音调的组合所能产生的任何效果。他很快发现，某些和弦总是会导致远处物体的强烈震动。”

This was further explained by stating that, "The discovery of the fact that objects composed of a material such as glass could be made to vibrate at a distance only in response to one particular chord to which their mass seemed to respond led to the discovery on which his work is based—the finding of the so-called 'chord of mass' of any material body, and the application of this discovery to the production of vibrations at will. The utilization of this chord produces disintegration, and this disintegration in turn is, of course, capable of being converted into motion. " Although the consensus was that Keely's experiments in vibration had their origin in his knowledge of music, and were commenced in his childhood, sometimes a different story arose: "While he was working as a carpenter the vibrations of windows and glass dishes in response to the soundings of the various musical chords first set his mind upon the subject of vibrations and the curious sympathy between distant waves vibrating in harmony. He became interested in speculations concerning physical forces and originated many theories."19 It is even alleged that he simply became interested in music, and claimed that the tuning fork had suggested to him the idea of a new motive of power.

基利的实验源于他对音乐的了解，他从童年时期就开始了这些实验。他发现，由玻璃等材料组成的物体只对其质量似乎会响应的特定音符做出远距离振动。这一发现成为他工作的基础，他找到了任何物体的所谓“质量和弦”，并将这一发现应用于随意产生振动。这个和弦可以产生分解，而这种分解反过来当然可以转化为运动。有时人们会听到不同的故事，例如他在做木匠的时候，窗户和玻璃碗对各种乐曲和弦发出的振动首次使他对振动和远距离振动声波之间的奇妙共鸣产生兴趣。他的兴趣围绕着物理力量的猜想，他创造了许多理论，甚至有人声称他只是对音乐感兴趣，并声称音叉向他提出了动力来源的新思路。

Apart from working as a carpenter's apprentice, Keely also held other jobs to sustain his living in his pre-motor-fame days. A Philadelphia newspaper, while admitting that of Keely's early life, "little is publicly known," wrote: "He was born in this dear town of ours, and when he was 10 years of age, was thrust out in the world to battle alone. He had two hobbies, music and mechanics. He was a cabinet-maker and musician by turns. The shop in which he worked at the former, some say, was on Market Street, while others claim it was on Jayne Street...."

除了担任木匠学徒的工作之外，在基利成名前的日子里，他还有其他的工作来维持生计。《费城报》在承认基利早年生活“公开知道的很少”时写道：“他出生在我们亲爱的小镇上，在10岁时便被推向了世界，独力与之抗争。他有两个爱好，音乐和机械。他时而是木匠，时而是音乐家。有人说，他在前者的车间工作，位于市场街上，而其他人则认为它在杰恩街上...”

During these early years Keely also worked from time to time as a physician, a pharmacist, "and in other occupations...," as an upholster or a cabinetmaker. Keely "worked at many trades to which he had not been apprenticed. He was a plumber, plasterer, carpenter, mason and many other things combined...," and elsewhere it was added: "He is said to have been employed in various business establishments in this city, where it was noticed that he had an inventive genius and gave much more attention to mechanical problems than to his employment...."

Machine: 在这些早年，基利还偶尔担任过医师、药剂师，“以及其他职业……”，如衬垫师或家具制造商。基利“从事了许多他没有学徒的职业。他是管道工、抹灰工、木匠、石匠以及许多其他的职业的综合……”，另有人补充道：“据说他曾在这个城市的各种企业中工作，人们注意到他具有创造性天赋，对机械问题给予了更多的关注，而不是他的工作....”

When Keely was about 20 years of age, and it is asserted that he showed in his youth "great interest in physics and chemistry and a wonderful desire for adventure," he went to work in a drugstore in Philadelphia, where he remained for a few years. He then left this job to become a locomotive engineer on the Pennsylvania Railroad, where he "passed several years in an engineer's cab." In 1850, he returned to be a druggist's clerk, but "When the Indian troubles in the West excited the country he joined the army..." There he led a life of adventure for a time, until he was wounded during an uprising of the Native Americans and was sent to a hospital. After his recovery, he returned to Philadelphia and played in an orchestra. Possibly this was around 1856, when Keely was "a varnisher by trade, and in addition a flutist and writer of music..."

基利约20岁时，据说他在年轻时表现出对物理和化学的浓厚兴趣和对冒险的极大渴望。他来到费城的一家药店工作，待了几年。然后他离开这份工作成为宾夕法尼亚铁路的一名机车工程师，在一个工程师的驾驶室里度过了几年时间。1850年，他回到药店当药剂师的助手，但“当西部印第安人的麻烦引起国内轰动时，他参军了……”他在那里过了一段冒险生涯，直到在印第安人的起义中受伤被送到医院。康复后，他返回费城，加入了一个管弦乐队。可能是在1856年左右，当时基利是“一名上光漆的工匠，此外还是一名长笛演奏者和作曲家……”

That Keely at one time was a flutist, but not the leader in an orchestra as is so often alleged, stems from the recollection of a certain W.D. who wrote about the time "long before the Keely motor was known." The author claimed to have spent "many nights in a musical way" with Keely: "He appeared to me to fall into deep thought
during the intervals of our performances, and it was no uncommon thing to have to rouse him from his abstraction. At times he would turn to me, who sat next him, and with great animation explain some improvement, or satisfactory result about an experiment regarding machinery. As I knew nothing of the subject, I could only
politely congratulate him."

基利曾经是一名长笛演奏者，但并非像经常被炒作的那样是管弦乐队的领导者，这是因为某个名叫W.D.的人回忆说“在基利马达出现很久之前”，他与基利一起度过了“许多个音乐之夜”：“在演出间歇期间，他似乎会陷入沉思，常常需要我把他从沉思中唤醒。有时，他会转向坐在他旁边的我，并高兴地解释有关机器的一些改进或令人满意的实验结果。由于我对这个主题一无所知，我只能很有礼貌地祝贺他。”

If the memory of the writer was correct, this again is a hint that Keely, long before his invention of the device that brought him fame, was deeply involved in similar pursuits. The writer gives other interesting details of his early life: "I remember that our party performed at Atlantic City on one occasion, and the next day, seated in the shade with a friend, I saw Keely in a black frock coat buttoned across his breast and a
high silk hat, walking along in the sun in an absorbed manner. The heat was terrible— I think about 98 degrees—and when I made a remark about Keely to my companion, he said: 'Oh, John don't know anything about the heat: his brain is busy with some jimcrank about an engine.' His instrument was the flute, upon which he had a
remarkable degree of execution; in fact, he was constantly introducing turns and trills, to the annoyance of our professor. On one occasion we were about to play the 'Immortal Waltzes,' and our leader took occasion to speak of the beautiful simplicity of the first movement; but Keely was deep in thought, and when he played his part introduced the most florid turns, at which the professor rapped fiercely and shouted: 'For heaven's sake, John Keely, stop your infernal frills!' This reproof was taken calmly, and the offense was not repeated. A most pleasant and agreeable man he was socially, although subject, even in those days, to fits of deep and intense thought."

如果这位作者的记忆是正确的，那么这又表明了基利在发明让他闻名的装置之前，很早就深入涉足了类似的追求。作者提供了他早期生活的其他有趣细节:“我记得我们的小组有一次在大西洋城演出，第二天，我和一个朋友坐在树荫下，看到基利身穿一件扣在胸前的黑色燕尾服和一顶高顶丝绸帽，在烈日下专注地走着。天气非常炎热——我想大约有98度——当我对我的同伴提到基利时，他说:“哦，约翰不知道热:他的大脑正忙于某个引擎的愚蠢问题。”他的乐器是长笛，在上面他有出色的技巧;事实上，他经常加入各种花样和颤音，这让我们的教授感到很不悦。有一次，我们准备演奏“不朽的华尔兹”，我们的领导人借此机会谈到了第一乐章的美丽简单性；但基利正陷入沉思，当他演奏他的部分时，引入了最繁华的转折，这让教授大声呵斥：“拜托了，约翰·基利，别再做你那可恶的花哨了！”这种惩罚被平静地接受了，这种冒犯也没有再发生。他在社交场合非常愉快和友善，尽管即使在那些日子里，他也容易陷入深思熟虑的状态。

There is also a rumor that in his early life Keely was a sleight-of-hand performer and a circus performer. That he worked in a circus was already doubted in his time: "...Keely in earlier life was a cannon-ball tosser and went around the country with a circus throwing cannon-balls in the air, and catching them in his hands.... That story has since been denied." But although denied, doubts remained: "I think there must be truth in it, for away back in the early seventies...it was my great privilege...to have an introduction. ... I was told by the friend who did me this favor, and who had a close intimacy with Keely as a neighborhood-born companion for years, that for a certain time he was connected with a travelling circus...."

Machine: 还有一个传言称，在他的早年，基利是一个魔术师和马戏团表演者。在他的时代，他在马戏团工作的事情已经存在怀疑：“……基利在早年是一个炮弹投手，和一个马戏团一起在全国各地表演，将炮弹扔到空中，然后接住…… 但是这个故事后来被否认了。”然而，虽然被否认了，但还是存在怀疑：“我认为这一定有些真实性，因为早在七十年代初，我很荣幸……被介绍认识了他……那个为我效劳的朋友告诉我，他和基利是邻居，几年来一直有着密切的关系，基利曾经一段时间与一个旅行马戏团有关联......"

This doubt has remained ever since, and current conventional historical sources consider Keely's circus career as more or less apocryphal. The general confusion at that time, the lack of biographical data and the various anecdotes, similar or different, substantiated or unsubstantiated, would also influence later writers about him.

这种怀疑一直存在至今，当前的传统历史资料认为基利的马戏团生涯多少是虚构的。那个时代的普遍混乱、缺乏传记资料和各种各样的轶闻，有些相似，有些不同，有些有根据，有些没有根据，这些都会影响以后关于他的作家们。

To reconstruct Keely's early life, we must therefore include a biographical sketch of him, that—although colorful—is probably loosely based on such sources as referred to above, and remains unsubstantiated as well: "He worked as a carpenter, played violin in a small orchestra, showed amazing dexterity with card tricks and other paraphernalia of the magician's trade. John longed for adventure and joined a group of trappers who spent three years in the Rockies. Badly wounded by an Indian arrow, John came home to the relative safety of Philadelphia." It was there that he befriended mechanics and professors and "within a few years had acquired smatterings of the fundamentals of both science and machinery."

要重建基利的早年生活，因此我们必须包括他的传记草图，尽管它色彩丰富，但可能基于上述提到的来源而宽泛，也仍然没有得到证实：“他曾经做过木工，在一个小乐队中演奏小提琴，展示了惊人的卡牌技巧和魔术师的其他配件。约翰渴望冒险，加入了一群在落基山脉度过三年的捕猎者。被印第安人箭伤了，约翰回到了相对安全的费城。在那里，他结识了机械师和教授，“几年内掌握了科学和机械基础的零碎知识。”

On only very rare moments, Keely himself confided details of his early life to a reporter. While he denies ever having been a carpenter, we also perceive details of what must have been a most unusual career at times: "'Are you a spiritualist, Mr. Keely?' I asked him. 'That is one of many lies propagated about me,' he answered. 'It has been said I started life as a carpenter (though that is not a slander), but I didn't: I never was a carpenter. Instead of being a Spiritualist myself, I once exposed Spiritualistic mediums in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1857, 1859 and 1861, and I was nearly run out of town for doing so. Everything their mediums did in the dark, I did in the light, and that naturally enraged them. I do not believe in Spiritualism or in
anything of the kind. I am, I hope, a Christian, and a regular member of the Methodist Church....'"

基利自己只在极少数时刻向记者透露了他早年生活的细节。虽然他否认曾经是一名木工，但有时我们也能看到他一些非常不寻常的经历的细节：“‘你是一名灵媒吗，基利先生？’我问他。‘这是关于我的许多谎言之一，’他回答道。‘有人说我一开始是个木工（尽管这不是诽谤），但我不是：我从来不是木工。我曾在圣保罗、明尼苏达州，在1857年、1859年和1861年揭露过灵媒，几乎被赶出了城。他们的灵媒在黑暗中所做的一切，我都在明亮的光线下做了，这自然激怒了他们。我不相信灵媒或任何类似的事情。我是一个基督徒，一个方法教会的常规成员...’”

While it is asserted that Keely made his discovery in his childhood, long before he announced it to the public, it is also claimed that this was accompanied by the construction of a number of curious devices or prototypes of engines. A theosophist wrote that Keely "...has worked since he was a boy, at times, upon various inventions
before his discovery of ether...."

虽然有人声称基利在童年时期就已经发现了他的发明，比他公开宣布的时间更早，但也有人声称这一发现伴随着一些奇怪的设备或发动机的原型的建造。一位神秘学家写道，基利“……在发现以太之前，他曾在某些时候，从小就一直致力于各种发明。”

There is a description of what may be one of Keely's very first devices, but unfortunately no date or time period is given: "His earliest mechanism for noting the uniform force of sound vibrations was a steel bar set full of pins of various lengths, while his first 'resonator,' or 'intensifier,' consisted of a shingle screwed to two hollow wooden tubes. Keely's first rudimentary engine was 'a simple ring of steel with 300 pins set into it, and this first wheel ran in an open box, into and through which an observer was free to look while the wheel was in motion...'"

有一种描述可能是基利的第一个设备之一，但不幸的是没有给出日期或时间段：“他最早用于记录声音振动的均匀力的机制是一个装满不同长度的针的钢杆，而他的第一个“共振器”或“增强器”是由一个木片和两个空心木管固定而成的。基利最初的基本发动机是“一个简单的钢环，上面有300根针，这个第一个轮子在一个开放的盒子里运转，观察者可以在轮子运动时自由地看到这个盒子……”

In 1856, Keely "had running and was experimenting with a toy engine, the boiler of which was fired by a 'burning fluid lamp' in his home on Fifth Street, five or six doors above Queen Street."40 In 1863, Keely became employed as a furniture varnisher at \$10 per week in the furniture shop of Bennet C. Wilson.

在1856年，基利“已经开始运用一个玩具发动机进行实验，这个锅炉是由一盏在他位于第五街、在皇后街上方5或6个门的家中点燃的‘燃烧流体灯’来加热的。”40在1863年，基利在Bennet C. Wilson的家具店里以每周10美元的薪水担任家具漆工。

Wilson financed Keely's experiments and provided him with a furnished shop on Market Street in which to work. There Keely experimented "year after year" with an engine which he called a "reacting vibratory motor." This led to the construction of a device invented in 1869 that can be considered the forerunner of his Globe Motor.

Wilson为基利的实验提供了资金，并为他提供了一个位于Market Street的家具店铺供他使用。在那里，基利用一种被称为“反应性振动马达”的发动机进行了多年的实验。这导致了他于1869年发明的一种装置，可以视为他的地球马达的先驱。

It is alleged that Keely's motor began to attract attention as early as 1865, but around 1871 he started to try to put his discovery into practical, commercial use, for it is claimed that he announced his invention to the public in that year. Keely, who at the time was "a varnisher of furniture on Market Street, above Seventh," put an advertisement in a Philadelphia evening paper "relating to a new motor, or motive power, which he alleged he had invented or discovered and was prepared to exhibit." This new motor was named the "Globe Motor," presumably because it consisted of a hollow sphere, which revolved at great speed and, as Keely declared, automatically. "It was seen in motion at different times by different persons, but always while in the
presence and under the control of Keely. ...The motor attracted the attention of two gentlemen of capital in our city, who consented to advance money with the view of developing this invention and others which Mr. Keely claimed to have made...."

据称，基利的马达早在1865年就开始引起人们的关注，但直到1871年左右，他才开始试图将自己的发现投入实际商业应用。据称，他在那一年向公众宣布了他的发明。当时的基利是“马克市场七号楼上的家具涂漆匠”，在费城的一个晚报上刊登了一则广告，“涉及他所声称发明或发现的新型马达或动力装置，并准备展示”。这种新型马达被命名为“地球马达”，可能是因为它由一个空心球体组成，以极快的速度旋转，正如基利所宣称的那样，自动运转。“不同的人在不同的时间看到过它在运动，但它总是在基利的见证和控制下。……这个马达引起了我们城市的两位有资本的绅士的注意，他们同意提供资金，以开发这种发明和基利声称已经做出的其他发明……”

The recollection of another man who was also drawn to Keely's Globe Motor and who retold the incident 30 years later, seems to confirm other allegations that Keely had a globular motor in operation in 1871. In fact, if the 30-year period would be correct, it would mean that Keely had already constructed his device prior to 1869.

另一位被吸引到基利的 地球马达 的人的回忆被重新讲述了30年后，似乎证实了其他指控，即基利在1871年已经有一个球形马达在运行。事实上，如果这个30年的时间周期是正确的，那就意味着基利在1869年之前已经制造出了他的装置。

The man who came forward after all these years was one Joseph Repetti, decribed as an "expert Vineland machinist and inventor" and "a Mason of excellent standing in the local lodge and a highly respected citizen, whose veracity and capabilities are well known in Vineland." Repetti stated that he knew Keely's much-talked-about secret, and that he was "the only person to whom Keely ever showed his complete motor." Of course this was nonsense; Keely built several devices, of which the Globe Motor was only one, but again it reflects something of the confusion that has always surrounded historical data concerning Keely, even in his day.

这个人名叫约瑟夫·雷佩蒂，是一个被描述为“维尼兰熟练机械师和发明家”的专家，也是当地党派中地位优越的共济会成员和备受尊敬的公民，他的真诚和能力在维尼兰地区广受好评。雷佩蒂声称他知道基利备受关注的秘密，并且是“基利向他展示完整的马达的唯一人。”当然，这是无稽之谈；基利制造了几个装置，其中球形马达只是其中之一，但这再次反映了关于基利历史资料的混乱，即使在他的时代也是如此。

Repetti, who lived in Philadelphia, remembered how he met Keely around 1869. According to him, "It had become noised about that a Mr. Keely, who then occupied rooms on Market Street, had accomplished perpetual motion. I became very much interested and, securing permission from my employer, decided to take a half-day off and visit the much-talked-of Keely at his place of work and have a talk. Accordingly I made a call. Mr. Keely was, to all appearances, carrying on a second-hand furniture business. I said: 'I am interested in the report that you have solved the problem of perpetual motion. I am a machinist employed in the city, at the shops of Vere, Camp & Leopold. I have also been working for some time on a machine for the same purpose and am interested in the subject. This is why I have called.' Mr. Keely replied: 'The machine to which you refer is not in running order, but if you will wait for a few minutes I will put it together and show it to you.' In a few minutes, Mr. Keely, who had retired to his workshop, called me to that apartment showing me a peculiarly constructed machine in the form of a globe, of about eight inches in diameter. The ball had a vertical rotary motion. I inquired: 'How long would the machine continue to revolve?' 'Until worn out,' replied Mr. Keely. I asked: 'Does the machine develop any power?' Mr. Keely, placing his finger on the revolving globe, stopped it, saying: 'This machine is too small to develop much power. I shall make a larger machine that will have power to run other machines.' Keely then stated that he had not begun the actual construction yet, but that he had decided the size of the machine, and that the ball would be 'between five and six feet in diameter.' Keely also stated that he didn't know when he would start the construction; that would depend on the help 'from the outside' that he could get. When Repetti asked how much help it would take, Keely's answer was, 'Something like one thousand dollars.'"

雷佩蒂住在费城，他记得约在1869年左右认识了基利。据他说，“当时有传言说一个名叫基利的人，他住在市场街上的房间里，已经实现了永动机。我非常感兴趣，经过雇主的许可，决定半天假期去拜访这位备受瞩目的基利，在他的工作场所交谈。于是我去了。基利先生表面上正在经营二手家具生意。我说：‘我对你解决永动机问题的报告很感兴趣。我是一个在维尔、坎普和利奥波尔德（Vere, Camp & Leopold）工作的机械师。我也已经在同样的目的上工作了一段时间，对这个主题很感兴趣，这就是为什么我来了。'基利先生回答说：‘你提到的机器还没有运转，但如果你等几分钟，我会把它组装起来给你看。’几分钟后，基利先生退到他的车间里，叫我到那间房间，向我展示了一个奇特的球形机器，直径约为八英寸。这个球有一个垂直旋转的动作。我问：‘这个机器会持续旋转多久？’‘直到磨损为止，’基利先生回答。我问：‘这个机器会发展出任何能量吗？’基利先生把手指放在旋转的球上，停下它，说：‘这个机器太小了，无法发展出很大的能量。我将制造一个更大的机器，能够运转其他机器。’基利随后表示，他还没有开始实际的施工，但他已经决定了机器的大小，球的直径将在“五到六英尺之间”。基利还表示，他不知道何时会开始建造，这将取决于他能获得的外部帮助。当雷佩蒂问需要多少帮助时，基利的回答是：“大约需要一千美元左右”。

At first, Repetti saw something in Keely's device, for he offered to build certain parts of his machine at the workshop of his employers, where he had access to the "proper tools." Keely's reply was enigmatic: "I cannot answer just now, but if you will call in a few days I will let you know what I will do."

起初，雷佩蒂在基利的装置中看到了一些东西，因为他提议在他雇主的工作室建造他的机器的某些部件，那里有“适当的工具”。基利的回答很神秘：“我现在无法回答，但如果你再过几天来看我，我会让你知道我将要做什么。”

Repetti returned and Keely stated that he would go along with his offer, but only if Repetti would pay for the making of the machine, for which he was to receive "a half interest for doing so." Repetti agreed on the condition that he could see all the parts of the Globe Motor "in order to know if I can make them." Keely did not object to this, but told Repetti: "I cannot show them to you now. You will have to call some other time," which Repetti did, and within a few days. The machine had been taken apart and the parts were spread out on the table in the workshop. Keely said: "You can examine the parts and determine if you can make them." Repetti did this and said that he saw no difficulties. But then Keely said that he had a secret part that he could not show without Repetti's promise to oblige himself by oath not to tell anyone. Repetti agreed and Keely "went into another room and brought out the part and showed it to me, after which I said: 'I am very sorry, Mr. Keely, that I have put you to so much trouble, but I think that I will not go into this business any farther....'"

雷佩蒂回来后，基利表示他将接受他的提议，但前提是雷佩蒂必须支付机器的制造费用，并因此得到“一半的利益”。雷佩蒂同意，条件是他可以看到“地球电机”的所有部件，“以便我知道我是否能制造它们。”基利并未反对，但告诉雷佩蒂：“我现在不能给你看。你必须另外再来一次，”而雷佩蒂确实又来了，只用了几天的时间。这台机器被拆开了，零件散落在工作室的桌子上。基利说：“你可以检查这些部件，看看你能否制造它们。”雷佩蒂照做了，他说他没有看到任何困难。但是接着基利说，他还有一个秘密部件，如果不立誓保密，就不能出示给雷佩蒂看。雷佩蒂同意了，并表示，基利“走进另一个房间，拿出部件给我看，之后我说：‘非常抱歉，基利先生，我让你费了这么大的力气，但我觉得我不会再深入这个业务了……’”

What Repetti saw that changed his mind, he kept secret for 30 years offering no further explanation. Repetti's tale might be truthful in some respects: There is evidence that Keely indeed was living at Market Street around that time; he lived there in 1866, as he admitted.

雷佩蒂看到了什么改变了他的想法，他保守了30年的秘密，没有进一步的解释。雷佩蒂的故事在某些方面可能是真实的：有证据表明基利确实在那个时候住在市场街上；正如他承认的那样，他在1866年住在那里。

In 1871, Keely pursued his investigations in the effort to work out his discovery, using water and air in connection with sound vibrations.46 In 1872, he allegedly made his discovery of an energy that he called "the force" by accident, while experimenting on vibrations. He then "imprisoned the ether" the same year and "commenced his experiments with ether in the winter of 1872-73...."47 At first he had no idea what he had found, as he readily admitted; it would take him 12 years before he realized that he had "imprisoned the ether."

1871年，基利继续他的研究，试图利用水和空气结合声波振动研究他的发现。 1872年，他据称在振动实验中意外发现了一种他称之为“力量”的能量。那年他把“以太囚禁”了起来，并在“1872-73年冬季开始了他的以太实验...” 最初，他不知道自己发现了什么，正如他自己承认的那样；他花了12年时间才意识到他已经“囚禁了以太”。

Between 1871 and 1875, he also constructed six different devices. At that time, 34 documents were in existence relating to the transfer of interests in inventions which were called the independent flywheel, the hydro-pneumatic-pul-sating-vacuo engine, the Globe Motor, the dissipating engine, the multiplicator or generator and the automatic water lift. The first assignment was dated July 11, 1871, the last, February 15, 1875.

在1871年至1875年期间，他还制造了六种不同的设备。当时存在着34个文件，涉及到发明的利益转移，这些发明包括独立飞轮、液压气动脉动真空发动机、环球电机、耗散发动机、增殖器或发电机以及自动升水机。第一份转让文件日期为1871年7月11日，最后一份为1875年2月15日。

Keely's Globe Motor, although exhibited in operation around 1871, was never patented; what was found during an investigation in 1875 was "on record in Liber L, 18, page 370, of transfer of patents, U.S. Patent Office, an assignment of this so-called Globe Motor by Mr. Collier to the Keely Motor Company, this assignment bearing
date February 15, 1875, and being recorded May 8, 1875." The patent office at that time also had an abstract of "all assignments, agreements, licenses, powers of attorney and other instruments in writing on record in the patent office in the name of John W. Keely since January 1, 1871."

基利的环球电机虽然在1871年左右进行了展示，但从未获得专利。在1875年的一次调查中发现，“根据美国专利局专利转让的资料记录（Liber L, 18, page 370），柯利尔先生把所谓的环球电机转让给了基利发动机公司，该转让文件的日期是1875年2月15日，并于1875年5月8日记录。”当时的专利局还收集了所有于1871年1月1日以后以约翰·W·基利的名义在专利局内记录的“所有转让、协议、许可证、授权书和其他书面文件的摘要”。

However, there does exist a patent by Keely, granted August 15, 1871, for his flywheel, an arrangement of gearing for causing a wheel to revolve at a greater speed than the shaft to which it is hung.

然而，基利确实拥有一项专利，于1871年8月15日授予，用于他的飞轮，这是一种齿轮安排，使轮子以比它悬挂的轴更快的速度旋转。

In 1872, Keely constructed a new motor at his place in Market Street.50 This second motor was variously called the "hydraulic motor," the "hydro-vacuo engine," the "hydro-pneumatic vacuum engine" and the  hydro-pneumatic-pulsating vacuum engine."51 A New Yorker who claimed to have known him during that time later wrote that, "I was with him when the idea first entered his head that he could combine steam and water to run an engine. At that time he made a crude machine, which he actually ran for some time; and this was the model of the Pneumatic-Pulsating-Vacuo-Engine.... In those days I have known him to sell and pawn everything of value in his house to obtain means to continue his investigation with the money thus acquired."

1872年，基利在Market Street上建造了一台新的发动机。这第二个发动机被不同的人称为“液压发动机”，“水力抽真空发动机”，“液压抽真空发动机”和“液压脉动抽真空发动机”。一位声称在那段时间认识他的纽约人后来写道：“当他第一次想到将蒸汽和水结合起来驱动发动机时，我和他在一起。当时他制造了一台粗糙的机器，他实际上运行了一段时间；这就是脉动抽真空发动机的样板....那些日子里，我知道他出售和典当了他房子里所有有价值的东西，以获得继续研究的资金。”

This model was subsequently located at 1010 Ogden Street in Philadelphia, where Keely was then living. The model was described as an engine placed in a bathtub and run by a stream of water that passed through a goose quill. This device "...soon grew into the machine which he called a 'generator,' and which the world named the Keely motor, and in which power was produced from the vibratory qualities of water and air."53 Elsewhere it is claimed that the generator not so much evolved out of his hydropneumatic-pulsating-vacuo engine, but that after its construction, Keely "took a new departure," which culminated in the so-called Keely motor, or, as it has been termed, "a dissipating engine and multiplicator and generator."

这个模型后来被发现位于费城的奥格登街1010号，当时基利就住在那里。这个模型被描述为放在浴缸里的发动机，通过鹅毛笔道流水驱动。这个装置“......很快就发展成了他所称的‘发生器’，也就是世界上所称的基利电机，从水和空气的振动品质中产生动力。”另外有人声称，这个发生器并不是他的液压脉动抽真空发动机演变而来的，而是在建造完成后，基利“开始了新的探索”，最终形成了所谓的基利电机，或者可以称之为“消散型发动机、倍增器和发生器”。

While working with his generator one day in 1873, Keely "suddenly felt a cold vapor blow in his face. He tried to wipe away the moisture, but was surprised to find there was none upon his countenance...The curious phenomenon of a vapor that was absolutely dry caused him to take up a new line of experiment."

1873年有一天，基利在使用他的发生器时，“突然感到一股冷气吹在他的脸上。他试图擦掉湿气，但惊讶地发现他的脸上没有湿气......这种绝对干燥的蒸汽的奇特现象，促使他开始尝试新的实验。”

This mysterious vapor was described as "a heretofore unknown gaseous or vaporic substance," and it was the power on which the generator—also termed the dissipator or the Keely motor—worked. Keely, being "a poor man, but, having a wonderful degree of natural mechanical skill...devoted all his time for the past fourteen years to experiments with water with a view of procuring a motive power from it. He was engaged upon an idea of his own regarding the force of columns of water when he accidentally discovered the vapor which he has harnessed.
He studied the subject, ascertained how it was generated, learned its power, and thenceforth applied himself solely to the perfection of this idea, working night and day for a number of years, until his efforts were crowned with success."57 Since the above quote is taken from an article written in 1875, this would imply that Keely was involved in this line of research since 1861.

这种神秘的蒸汽被描述为“一个此前未知的气体或蒸汽物质”，这就是发生器 - 也称为消散器或基利发动机 - 的动力所在。基利是“一个穷人，但具有非凡的天生机械技能......过去十四年来，他一直致力于用水进行实验，以期从中获得动力。他在研究关于水柱力量的想法时，偶然发现了这种蒸汽，然后他就马上研究这个问题，了解它是如何产生的，学习它的力量，并且从此专注于完善这个想法，日夜工作多年，直到他的努力获得了成功。”由于以上引用摘自1875年的一篇文章，这意味着基利自1861年以来就涉足这个研究领域。

That it is successively claimed that he discovered the force in 1872 and 1873 is explained thus: Keely, while "experimenting with a hydraulic engine...according to his own statement... accidentally made his discovery of the tremendous and mysterious energy which he afterwards pronounced to be etheric force. Over a year passed in various experiments...before he was able to repeat its production at will."

据称，基利分别在1872年和1873年发现了这种力量的原因是这样解释的：基利在“进行水力发动机实验时......根据他自己的说法......偶然发现了他后来宣称为乙太能量的巨大而神秘的能量。在做了各种实验之后，过了一年多的时间......才能够随意重复它的产生。”

Elsewhere it is confirmed that in 1873 Keely became known as the discoverer of a new power, "which he had not then been able to utilize, to operate machinery, but which could be supplied in limitless quantities at practically no cost. ...He said himself that he made the discovery in 1872, but then had no idea of its origin or laws. He gave no indication of its character, but kept the secret within his own breast until such time as patents could be secured...."

其他地方证实，1873年基利成为一种新动力的发现者，“他当时还无法利用这种动力来操作机器，但可以以几乎没有成本的方式提供无限量。...他自己说他在1872年发现了这个发现，但当时对它的起源或规律毫无概念。他没有透露它的特性，而是将这个秘密保持在自己的心里，直到可以获得专利的时候 ......”

Keely did attempt to secure a patent on his device, which was filed on November 14, 1872, titled: "Specification describing a new and useful Hydro Vacuo Engine, invented by John W. Keely of the City and County of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania." The purpose of the machine was described as follows: "The end and design of the invention is an engine wherein the actuating power is produced by a vacuum in connection with water pressure."

基利确实试图申请他的装置的专利，该专利于1872年11月14日提交，标题为：“一种由宾夕法尼亚州费城市和县的约翰·W·基利发明的新型有用水力真空发动机的规范描述。”该机器的主要目的如下所述： “这项发明的终极目标是一种引擎，其中驱动动力是通过真空与水压相关联产生的。”

Yet nothing came of his application. When information was gathered around 1875, a search of the records of the patent office brought to light an abandoned application for a patent for the hydro-vacuo engine, "the said application having been filed November 14, 1872...At the request of the applicant's attorney, a model was dispensed with by the authorities in the first instance; but on November 26, 1872, a working model was demanded before the examination could be completed. Whenever an application for a patent is of doubtful practicability, or based on what is believed to be a fallacy, it is the practice of the patent office authorities to demand a working model, and to refuse to examine the case until the demand is complied with. Nothing was done in this case of Keely's until March 20, 1874, when he appointed Mr. J. Snowden Bell, now the mechanical associate of Mr. Collier, to prosecute the application; but as two years elapsed without any action, the application was thereby under the law abandoned."

然而，他的申请并没有成功。大约在1875年，人们收集信息时，在专利局的记录中发现了一份被放弃的水力真空发动机专利申请，“该申请于1872年11月14日提交...根据申请人的律师的要求，在第一阶段被主管机关豁免了模型；但是在1872年11月26日，要求在审查完成之前提供工作模型。每当一个专利申请的可行性存在疑问，或者基于被认为是谬误的理论时，专利局当局的做法是要求提供一个工作模型，并拒绝在满足要求之前对该申请进行审查。在基利的这个案例中，直到1874年3月20日时，他任命现在是柯利尔先生的机械合伙人的J·斯诺登·贝尔（J. Snowden Bell）代表他推进申请，但两年过去了没有任何行动，根据法律规定，该申请因此被放弃了。

There are rumors of subsequent patents and the assignment of rights. Wilson for instance claimed that Keely had assigned to him "one full half ownership" of the principles or machine that he built in 1869.62 The other rumors stem in all probability from the 1871 patent, which was granted directly to the assignees, two unidentified persons who at first advanced money for the further development of the Globe Motor and the hydro-pneumatic-vacuo engine, or his patent application in 1872.

有传言称后来他取得了专利并转让了权利。例如，威尔逊声称基利已向他转让了他在1869年建造的机器的“全部半数产权”。另外一些传言很可能源自于1871年的专利，该专利直接授予了被指定人，这两个未知身份的人最初提供了进一步发展地球电机和水力气动真空发动机的资金，或者他在1872年的专利申请。

A mysterious patent that Keely supposedly requested on November 26, 1873, and of which it was remarked that the accompanying drawings "are now lost," never existed.64 In contemporary sources there is no further reference to other patents. It is stated that Keely did obtain a patent in 1874 on the hydro-pneumatic-pulsating-vacuo engine, the original design of the Keely motor.

传说基利于1873年11月26日申请了一个神秘的专利，但是伴随的图纸“现在已经丢失”，这个专利从来没有存在过。在当代资源中，没有进一步提到其他专利。据说基利在1874年获得了一项关于水力气动脉冲真空发动机的专利，这是基利电机的原始设计。

Around 1874 Keely moved to a building at 1420 N. Twentieth Street above Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia, where he established his workshop. There he would construct, over a period of a quarter of a century, various other motors and  devices. The workshop was a modest building that was formerly used as a stable. He used the first floor as a general storeroom, and there he conducted his "rough experiments." The second story consisted of three apartments, the first being the office of the inventor, the second the workshop for his globe engine, with an adjoining room where he "religiously guards his latest creation."

大约在1874年，基利搬到了费城里奇大道上方的第1420号N. Twentieth Street的一幢建筑中，建立了他的工作室。在那里，他将在一个季度的时间里建造各种其他的电机和装置。工作室是一个朴素的建筑物，曾经用作马厩。他将第一层用作一个通用的储藏室，并在那里进行他的“粗略实验”。第二层有三个公寓，第一个是发明家的办公室，第二个是他的地球发动机的车间，还有一个相邻的房间，他在那里“虔诚地守护他最新的创造”。

Several stories exist of the next important phase that was to be his breakthrough, and that would lead to the establishment of a company to fund his researches.

有几个故事记录了下一个重要阶段，这是他的突破，并将导致成立一家公司来资助他的研究。

One variant has it that Keely's new invention quickly drew the attention of a group of New York bankers and businessmen, and they asked Charles B. Collier, a wellknown patent attorney in Philadelphia, to investigate Keely's invention. Prior to this request, Collier alleged that he had never met Keely, although this is not certain, since he would contradict himself a number of times on this point over the years.

其中一种说法是，基利的新发明很快引起了一群纽约银行家和商人的注意，他们请了费城著名的专利律师查尔斯·B ·科利尔(Charles B. Collier)调查基利的发明。在这个请求之前，科利尔声称他从未见过基利，尽管这不确定，因为他多年来在这一点上曾经多次自相矛盾。

Another variant tells that around 1874 two persons, one in New York and one in New Jersey, held contracts with Keely, whereby they were entitled to certain rights in his inventions to be patented thereafter. By mutual consent they agreed to merge their respective rights into a corporation that would be known as the Keely Motor
Company. Collier was asked to be their counsel. "At that time," Collier wrote, "I knew but little of Keely's invention. I had seen in his workshop—a room say ten feet square—a 'receiver' charged with a vapor or gas having an elastic energy of 8,000 lbs. to the square inch. I interrogated Mr. Keely critically as to how he had produced this substance. Pointing to an inoffensive looking machine, which stood in close proximity to the receiver, he said to me that he introduced a certain quantity of air into that machine under no greater pressure than was the capacity of his lungs, a certain quantity of water under no greater pressure than was the ordinary hydrant pressure at his residence, and then, by a simple manipulation of the machine, unaided by any chemical substances, heat, electricity etc., he converted a small portion of the introduced water and air into  the cold vapor then contained in his receiver."

另一种说法是，大约在1874年，纽约和新泽西州各有一人与基利签订了合同，使他们有权获得他的发明在之后被授权的某些权利。经过双方同意，他们同意合并各自的权利成立一家名为基利马达公司的公司。科利尔被邀请成为他们的律师。 "当时，"科利尔写道，"我对基利的发明知之甚少。在他的车间里，我看到了一个充满弹性能量为每平方英寸8,000磅的蒸汽或气体的“接收器”。我对基利先生进行了严格的询问，询问他如何制造这种物质。他指着一个看起来很无害的机器，这个机器就在接收器的旁边，告诉我他将一定数量的空气输送到机器中，压力不超过他的肺容量，将一定数量的水输送到机器中，压力不超过他家中的普通自来水压力，然后通过对机器的简单操作，不借助任何化学物质、热能、电能等，将一小部分进入机器的水和空气转化为接收器中所含的冷蒸汽。"

Collier enquired into Keely's character, consulting Rutherford, chief engineer of the U.S. Navy, and Boekel. Collier was favorably impressed, signed an agreement with Keely and went to New York. There he met with some of the most influential citizens, among whom was Charles H. Haswell, who also visited Keely's workshop and had seen and reported on the receiver charged with the enormous vaporic pressure.

科利尔调查了基利的性格，并咨询了美国海军的首席工程师瑟瑞福德和博克尔。科利尔对基利留下了良好的印象，与他签订了一份协议，然后去了纽约。在那里，他与一些最有影响力的公民见面，其中包括查尔斯·H·哈斯韦尔，他也参观了基利的车间，见到并报告了充满巨大蒸汽压力的接收器。

The meeting resulted in 10,000 of the stock being subscribed. Collier made Keely's written declaration a part of his contract with them. Collier returned to Philadelphia with 3,000 and gave the money to Keely, who then paid the constructors of his machine 2,850. But the term of the agreement was that Keely was obliged to explain the principle of his invention, so Collier went to Keely's workshop with his engineering assistant, J. Snowdon Bell. But even with the sectional drawings of the machine—made by Bell—in front of them, Collier and Bell could not understand why the result would follow from its operation. Collier therefore requested Keely to put the machine together and give a demonstration.70 Collier and 10 others witnessed the experimental test run of the Keely motor that fateful night of November 10, 1874, in his workshop at N. Twentieth Street.

在会议上，订购了价值10000美元的股票。科利尔将基利的书面声明纳入他们的合同中。科利尔带着3000美元回到费城，然后把这笔钱交给基利，基利又支付了2800美元给机器的构造者。然而，协议中规定基利必须解释他的发明原理，所以科利尔带着他的工程助手J. Snowdon Bell来到基利的车间。但即使有Bell绘制的分段机器图，科利尔和Bell也无法理解为什么操作它会产生这样的结果。因此，科利尔要求基利将机器组装并进行演示。1874年11月10日那个命运之夜，在基利的N. Twentieth街车间，科利尔和其他10人见证了基利电机的试验运行。

The demonstration took place in a gas-lit room, with Collier holding a lighted candle. Keely proceeded to make an expulsion which meant that he would develop a force or pressure from the multiplicator. The force was sufficient to exert a pressure of 1,430 lbs. per square inch.73 He did this by blowing from his lungs for about 30 seconds into the nozzle upon the multiplicator. He then shut the cock and turned on the water from the hydrant. The water that was poured into the multiplicator had a pressure of twenty-six pounds and a quarter to the square inch. The operation was completed in about two minutes after the attachment of the hydrant was made by simultaneously opening two cocks upon tubes connected with the first and second drums, when the lever and the force register were raised.

演示在一间燃气灯照明的房间里进行，科利尔手持一支点燃的蜡烛。基利开始进行“驱逐”操作，这意味着他将从增倍器中产生一种力或压力。这种力足以产生每平方英寸1430磅的压力，他通过向增倍器的喷嘴中吹气约30秒钟来实现这一点。然后，他关闭了旋塞并打开了消防栓的水源。倒入增倍器的水具有每平方英寸26.25磅的压力。大约两分钟后，消防栓连接上了，他通过同时打开连接第一和第二个滚筒的两个管道上的旋塞，使操纵杆和力量计被抬起，完成了这个操作。

The multiplicator—or the generator—was not an engine or a motive power motor in the strictest sense; it served as an apparatus for containing the high pressure vaporic substance. The tube for the discharge of the vaporic substance was "about the size of an ordinary knitting needle," with about one-tenth of an inch bore. The first engine that was connected to the generator was a reaction wheel with two arms, each 2.5 inches long. There is no data on the size of the openings through which the vaporic substance escaped in contrary directions in the air, thus causing the arms to revolve.

增倍器或发生器严格来说并不是一个发动机或马达，而是作为一个装置来容纳高压蒸汽物质。用于排放蒸汽物质的管道“大约和普通的针织针一样大”，孔径大约为十分之一英寸左右，但数据并不确切。第一个连接到发生器的发动机是一个反作用轮，具有两个臂，每个臂长2.5英寸。不过，并没有关于穿过开口逆向跑出空气的蒸汽物质大小的数据，这就导致了臂的旋转。

The reaction wheel was screwed to the reservoir and was put into rotation at high velocity by the manipulation of two cocks. After two minutes, the reaction wheel was removed and connections were made to a small beam engine, which was rotated at 400 revolutions. After three minutes, the reaction wheel was once again rotated. After a minute, the wheel was stopped, and the gaseous fluid was allowed to escape against a candle flame and blow it out. Then the small beam engine was run again for a few turns. Two minutes later the reaction wheel was run again, then the experiments were concluded. The entire experiment lasted 17 minutes. Clocker, who constructed both the multiplicator and the engine, described the engine as having cylinders of three-inch bore and three-inch stroke, with a flywheel of 200 pounds weight, which revolved at 300 revolutions per minute.

 反作用轮被螺紧在水箱上，并通过操纵两个阀门以高速旋转。两分钟后，取下反作用轮并连接到一个小型蒸汽机，使其旋转400转。三分钟后，再次旋转反作用轮。一分钟后，停止旋转轮子，让气体流体对着蜡烛火焰并将其吹灭。然后再运行小型蒸汽机几圈。两分钟后，再次旋转反作用轮，然后实验就结束了。整个实验持续了17分钟。构建了乘法器和引擎的Clocker将引擎描述为具有三英寸孔径和行程的缸体，重量为200磅的飞轮，每分钟旋转300转。

It was also stated that the development of the force caused no noise and that no chemical compounds were used or could have been used without detection. Neither heat, galvanism nor electricty was used. The water was "as pure after it left the multiplicator as it was when introduced to the same." The gas had neither smell nor taste and would not ignite. When the multiplicator was dismantled, it showed no traces of chemicals or explosive substances.

还有人声称，这种力量的发展没有任何噪音，并且没有使用或可以使用的任何化学化合物，因为这些化合物会被检测出来。没有使用热能、化学能或电能。水从增倍器离开后仍然像刚注入时一样纯净。气体既没有气味也没有味道，并且不会燃烧。当增倍器被拆卸时，没有发现任何化学物质或爆炸性物质的痕迹。

Collier then wrote a report for the New York group, which included John J. Cisco, a wealthy banker and former United States Sub-Treasurer in New York; Charles G. Franklyn of the Cunard Line of steamships; Charles H. Haswell, the author of Haswell's tables and a leading authority among mechanicians—who already had visited Keely's workshop; Henry C. Sargeant, president of the Ingersoll Rock Drill Company; W.D. Hatch and Enos T. Throop of the Hatch Lithographic Company; John S. Smith of Baker, Smith & Co., the large manufacturers of steam heating apparatus; and William B. Meeker, a banker.

Collier随后为纽约组撰写了一份报告，其中包括约翰·J·西斯科（John J. Cisco），一名富有的银行家和前纽约的美国副司库；Cunard轮船公司的查尔斯·G·弗兰克林（Charles G. Franklyn）；哈斯威尔表格（Haswell's tables）的作者和机械师界的权威——已经拜访过基利工作室的查尔斯·H·哈斯威尔（Charles H. Haswell）；英格索尔岩钻公司（Ingersoll Rock Drill Company）的总裁亨利·C·萨金特（Henry C. Sargeant）；Hatch平版印刷公司（Hatch Lithographic Company）的W·D·哈奇（W.D. Hatch）和伊诺斯·T·思鲁普（Enos T. Throop）；大型蒸汽供暖设备制造商贝克·史密斯公司（Baker, Smith & Co.）的约翰·S·史密斯（John S. Smith）；以及银行家威廉·B·米克（William B. Meeker）。

Collier met with this powerful group of wealthy bankers, merchants and businessmen in the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York. With Sidney Dillon in the chair, they listened patiently to Collier's report, which had also been made in writing. Collier told his audience of Keely's claims to transform soundwaves in energies exceeding those of a hurricane. This new physical force, when properly applied, would generate immense powers. Keely also claimed that he would be able in a short time to take a train of cars from the Pennsylvania Railroad depot at 32nd and Market Streets to Jersey City in 60 minutes, with a power that could be stored in a teacup or in the hollow of his hand. With as much ease, he would also send a Cunarder across the Atlantic in 48 hours. With a bucket or a barrel of his "etheric force" he might move a continent! All the glories of the age of steam... "would be obsolete long before the close of the century."

Collier在纽约第五大道酒店与这一强大的财团会面，由银行家、商人和企业家组成，Sidney Dillon担任主席。他们耐心地听取了Collier的报告，该报告也已经以书面形式呈现。Collier向听众们介绍了基利的主张，声称能够将声波转化为能量，产生超过飓风的动力。当这种新的物理力量得到正确运用时，将会产生巨大的能量。基利还宣称，很快他将能够以一种可以存储在茶杯或手心中的动力，让从宾夕法尼亚铁路32nd和Market街车站出发的火车在短短的60分钟内到达新泽西城。同样容易，他还将能够在48小时内横渡大西洋。即使只是用一个桶或一个桶的他的“以太力量”，他也可以移动整个大陆！这一切都将使蒸汽时代的荣耀黯然失色，“在本世纪末之前，就将被淘汰”。

Collier convinced the New York businessmen, bankers and orthodox scientists, for the day after his lecture he was to receive a check for 10,000 for the purchase of stock of the Keely Motor Company and to pay the debts that he had incurred in the construction of his machine. The New York group was also given an option for 40,000 more of the stock. The option was kept open until Collier's report was confirmed. In the meantime Collier negotiated a sale of the rights for six New England states for an option of 50,000, the purchasers to invest half a million dollars to introduce the invention, and then to pay another half a million dollars. For the benefit of both groups of investors, a public exhibition was given in Philadelphia that was attended by 300 persons, including engineers and scientists from all parts of the country. The day after this exhibition, the investors handed over their checks for 40,000 and 50,000. Collier had now raised capital of 100,000.

Collier说服了当时的纽约商人、银行家及一些正统科学家，因为在他的讲座后，他将收到一张价值10,000美元的支票，用以购买基利发动机公司的股票并偿还已欠的债务。这个纽约的团队还获得了另外40,000美元的股票期权。这个期权一直保持开放状态，直到Collier的报告得到确认。同时，Collier还谈判出售六个新英格兰州的权利，以50,000美元的期权为代价，购买者需要投资50万美元来介绍这项发明，并支付另外50万美元。为了让两个投资者团体受益，基利在费城举行了一次公开展览，有来自全国各地的工程师和科学家参加。展览结束后的第二天，投资者交出了价值40,000美元和50,000美元的支票。Collier现在已经筹集到了100,000美元的资本。

Yet another variant of this important phase has it that there were two meetings of the wealthy group, and that Keely contacted Collier. When Keely succeeded in again producing this dry vapor, he called Collier's attention to it. Keely had built a machine which he called a multiplicator, the forerunner of his liberator and disintegrator. After getting an expert draftsman to make drawings of all its parts, Collier called a meeting of capitalists at the Gilsey House in New York in the fall of 1874 and laid the matter before them, telling them what he had personally witnessed. The result was that \$50,000 was "almost immediately" subscribed, and Boston parties also took \$50,000 worth of stock. Sidney Dillon presided over the second meeting of the group.

这个重要阶段的另一个版本是，富人团体开了两次会议，基利联系了科利尔。当基利再次成功制造干蒸汽时，他吸引了科利尔的注意。基利制造了一台他称之为multiplicator的机器，它是他后来的liberator和disintegrator的前身。在请来专业的绘图员制图之后，科利尔在1874年秋季在纽约Gilsey House召开了一次资本家会议，向他们讲述了他亲眼所见的情况。结果是，"几乎立即"就有50,000美元的资本认购，波士顿的投资者也认购了价值50,000美元的股票。西德尼·迪龙(Sidney Dillon)主持了团体的第二次会议。

Keely's demonstration on November 10 sparked the controversy regarding his claims that would mark his career for the rest of his life. From that date on Keely was to be a public character, supported in his livelihood by those who believed in the reality of his claims and the grandiose future of his inventions based on his discovery.

基利在11月10日的演示引发了一场争议，这场争议标志着他在其余生涯中的形象。从那时起，基利在公众中变得非常知名，他的生计也得到了那些相信他声明的人的支持，这些声明是基于他的发现而做出的，而这些发现也被认为拥有宏伟的未来。

Before the demonstration in 1874, the general public at large had heard nothing of Keely's generator, although, as we have seen, it is suggested by Repetti and others that prior to this time, the Philadelphians did hear rumors of Keely and his Globe Motor as far back as 1865.

在1874年的演示之前，大众几乎没有听说过基利的发电机。虽然，正如我们所知道的，Repetti和其他人暗示，早在1865年前，费城人已经听到过有关基利和他的Globe Motor的传言。

This 1874 demonstration probably accounts for the fact that most contemporary and later sources date his discovery and subsequent invention of the Keely Motor around 1874, and not three years earlier, when Keely apparently constructed his Globe Motor, obtained a patent on his flywheel and applied for a second patent in 1872. Why he never resolved this issue is one of the countless minor mysteries that riddle his life and career.

这次1874年的演示可能是导致当代和后来的大部分来源都将基利的发现和随后的基利电机发明追溯到1874年而不是三年前的原因，当时基利显然制造了他的Globe Motor，获得了他的飞轮专利并在1872年申请了第二个专利。为什么他从未解决这个问题是他生活和事业中无数微小谜团中的一个。

In 1874, Collier founded the Keely Motor Company together with Keely, his workman Beckel who "had worked for Keely a number of years," and Sergeant. Sergeant had been skeptical at first, but after a visit in July that year to Keely's workshop at the request of unidentified parties, "some of whom were pecuniarily interested in the discovery," he changed his mind. The interested parties desired a careful investigation to be made, and asked him to go to Keely's workshop as an  expert. Sergeant found Keely in his workshop, being "very jealous of his secret. He would not for a long time admit me to see what he was doing that I might investigate the matter. It was only after a strong pressure had been brought to bear on him that he consented to do as much as let me see him work, and when this was at length accomplished by the intervention of his friends who were interested in the invention... so great was his anxiety to keep the secret that the very stockholders were kept out of the room while we were together, and their counsil coming to the closed doors knocked, and was answered by Keely, who would not admit him." Keely not only demonstrated the enormous pressure that he could obtain with his device, but also let Sergeant handle the device himself: "At length he allowed me to work his machinery myself, and I found I could do so as he did; and the machinery for producing this vapor is so simple that a child eight years old could work it. Deception was impossible under such circumstances." Sergeant's reference to "stockholders" is an indication that alreadyinterested persons had begun to invest money in Keely's  nvention before the foundation of the Keely Motor Company.

1874年，科利尔与他的工匠贝克尔还有军士一起创立了基利电机公司。军士起初对基利持怀疑态度，但在同年7月去到基利的车间作为专家调查后改变了看法。一些感兴趣的人想要对基利的发明进行仔细的调查，并邀请军士前往基利的车间。军士在车间里见到了基利，但基利非常保护他的秘密，不愿意让任何人进入车间。在压力下，他最终同意让军士看到他工作，并让他自己操作设备。军士不仅看到了基利的设备可以产生巨大的压力，而且还自己操作了这个设备：“最后他允许我自己操作他的机器，我发现我能像他一样操作；而产生这种蒸汽的机器是如此简单，连一个8岁的孩子也能操作。在这种情况下，欺骗是不可能的。”军士提到“股东”，这表明在基利电机公司成立之前，已经有一些有兴趣的人开始投资基利的发明。

When the Keely Motor Company was established, it began selling stock to trusting shareholders throughout the United States. Not only businessmen, speculators and rich investors bought stock; there were thousands of stockholders in Philadelphia and other cities, who were clerks, shopgirls, widows and orphans, "all looking for the day when the increased value of their stock would make them independent."

基利电机公司成立后，开始向美国各地信任的股东出售股票。不仅是商人、投机者和富有的投资者购买股票；在费城和其他城市有成千上万的股东，他们是职员、售货员、寡妇和孤儿，"都希望有一天股票的增值能让他们独立起来。"

The headquarters of the Keely Motor Company were at Collier's office. The purpose of the company was to fund the research, construction and subsequent manufacture and marketing of the Keely Motor. But its organizers received stock without paying for it, and about three-fourths of the whole amount was thus given away by Keely. He kept about one-seventh, and "was cheated out of a good portion of that before he had gone far."

基利电机公司的总部设在科利尔斯办公室。该公司的目的是为基利马达的研究、建设以及后续的制造和营销筹集资金。但是，他的组织者得到的股票都是没有支付任何费用的，基利就这样送出了整个金额的三分之三。他自己只留下了大约七分之一的股份，“但在他刚刚开始时就被骗了许多”。

When the by-laws of the Keely Motor Company were published a year later, the title page proudly announced that it had amassed a capital of \$1,000,000 in 20,000 shares, each with a value of \$50.

一年后，基利电机公司的章程公布后，封面自豪地宣布，该公司已经积累了100万美元的资本，共计2万股，每股价值50美元。

The company would ultimately have a capital of \$5,000,000.87 This money went to Keely's salary, which was \$200 a month, the construction of his workshop and the building of other demonstration devices. Unscrupulous stock speculators were to cause Keely great difficulties however, and Keely saw very little of the proceeds. Nevertheless, he was now a public figure, and articles about him and his mysterious invention, or one should say discovery, began to appear at regular intervals in various newspapers and magazines. The Keely history was launched.

公司最终将拥有500万美元的资本。这些资金用于支付基利的薪水，每月200美元，建造他的工作室和其他展示设备的建设。然而，不道德的股票投机者将给基利带来很大的困难，而基利没有从这些资金中获得很多回报。尽管如此，他现在是一个公众人物，各种报纸和杂志定期刊登有关他和他神秘的发明（或者应该说是发现）的文章。基利的历史开始了。
