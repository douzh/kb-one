Theory and Formula of Aqueous Disintegration (by John Keely)

The peculiar conditions as associated with the gaseous elements of which water is composed, as regards the differential volume and gravity of its gases, make it a ready and fit subject of vibratory research. In submitting water to the influence of vibratory transmission, even on simple thirds, the high action induced on the hydrogen as contrasted with the one on the oxygen (under the same vibratory stream) causes the antagonism between these elements that induces dissociation. The differential antagonistic range of motion, so favoring the antagonistic thirds as to become thoroughly repellant. The gaseous element thus induced and registered, shows thousands of times much greater force as regards tenuity and volume than that induced by the chemical disintegration of heat, on the same medium. In all molecular dissociation or disintegration of both simple and compound elements, whether gaseous or solid, a stream of vibratory antagonistic thirds, sixths, or ninths, on their chord mass will compel progressive subdivisions. In the disintegration of water the instrument is set on thirds, sixths, and ninths, to get the best effects. These triple conditions are focalized on the neutral center of said instrument so as to induce perfect harmony or concordance to the chord note of the mass chord of the instruments full combination, after which the diatonic and the enharmonic scale located at the top of the instrument, or ring, is thoroughly harmonized with the scale of ninths which is placed at the base of the vibratory transmitter with the telephone head. The next step is to disturb the harmony on the concentrative thirds, between the transmitter and the disintegrator. This is done by rotating the siren so as to induce a sympathetic communication along the nodal transmitter, or wire, that associates the two instruments. When the note of the siren becomes concordant to the neutral center of the disintegrator, the highest order of sympathetic communication is established. It is now necessary to operate the transferable vibratory negatizer or negative accelerator, which is seated in the center of the diatonic and enharmonic ring, at the top of the disintegrator, and complete disintegration will follow (from the antagonisms induced on the concordants by said adjunct)in triple progression, thus: First thirds: Molecular dissociation resolving the water into a gaseous compound of hydrogen and oxygen. Second: sixths, resolving the hydrogen and oxygen into a new element by second order of dissociation, producing what I call low atomic ether. Third: ninths, the low atomic ether resolved into a new element, which I denominate high or second atomic harmonic. All these transmissions being simultaneous on the disturbance of sympathetic equilibrium by said negative accelerator.

中文: 与组成⽔的⽓态元素相关的特殊条件，以及其⽓体的不同体积和重⼒，使其成为振动研究的现成且合适的主题。在使⽔受到振动传递的影响时，即使是简单的thirds，与对氧的作⽤相⽐（在相同的振动流下），对氢引起的⾼作⽤导致这些元素之间的对抗，从⽽引起解离。不同的对抗性运动范围，有利于对抗性thirds，以致变得彻底排斥。在相同的介质上，由此引起和记录的⽓态元素在细度和体积⽅⾯表现出⽐由热的化学分解引起的⼒⼤数千倍的⼒。在简单和复合元素的所有分⼦解离或分解中，⽆论是⽓态还是固态，其弦质量上的⼀系列振动对抗性thirds、sixths或ninths将迫使渐进的细分。在⽔的分解中，仪器设置为ninths、ninths和ninths，以获得最佳效果。这些三重条件集中在所述乐器的中性中心，以引起与乐器全组合的质量弦的和弦音符的完美和谐或协调，之后，位于乐器顶部或环的全音阶和强音音阶与位于带电话头的振动发射器底部的ninths将完全协调。下一步是扰乱发射器和分解器之间的集中thirds，的和谐。这是通过旋转警报器来实现的，以便沿着连接两个仪器的节点发射器或导线进行交感通信。当警笛的音符与分解器的中性中心一致时，交感连接的最高秩序就建立了。现在需要操作可转移的振动否定器或负加速器，它位于崩解器顶部的全⾳阶和等⾳环的中⼼，并且完全崩解将随之⽽来（来⾃由所述辅助剂对和谐⾳引起的拮抗作⽤） ）三重级数，因此：thirds，：分⼦解离，将⽔分解成氢和氧的⽓态化合物。第⼆：sixths，通过⼆级解离将氢和氧分解成新元素，产⽣我所说的低原⼦以太。第三：ninths，低原⼦以太分解成⼀种新元素，我将其命名为⾼原⼦谐波或⼆次原⼦谐波。所有这些传输在所述负加速器对交感神经平衡的⼲扰上同时发⽣。

EXAMPLE:

Taking the chord mass of the disintegrator B flat, or any chord mass that may be represented by the combined association of all the mechanical parts of its structure (no two structures being alike in their chord masses) taking B flat, the resonators of said structure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave and B flat ninth octave by drawing out the caps of resonators until the harmony of thirds, sixths, and ninths are reached; which is simple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale, at the head, will determine by the tremulous action which is highly sensible to the touch, on said caps. The caps are then rigidly fixed in their different positions by set screws. The focalization to the neutral center is then established by dampening the steel rods, on the back of the scale, representing the thirds, sixths and ninths, drawing a piece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the chord mass of the instrument. Concordance is thus effected betweenthe disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at base of transmitters with telephonic head.

中文: 取分解器B的弦质量为平，或可由其结构的所有机械部件的组合组合表示的任何弦质量为B（没有两个结构的弦质量相同），通过拔出谐振器的帽，将所述结构的谐振器设置在B平的第一八度、B平的第三八度和B平的九度，直到达到thirds,、sixths和sixths的和声；这是手指在全音阶上在头部的简单运动，将由对所述帽子的触摸高度敏感的颤抖动作决定。然后通过固定螺钉将盖子刚性地固定在它们的不同位置。然后，通过阻尼标尺背面代表thirds,、sixths和sixths的钢条，在钢条上画一根小胶管，来建立对中性中心的聚焦，从而与乐器的和弦质量建立和谐。

This scale has a permanent sympathetic one, set on the ninth of any mass chord that may be represented, on any and all the multiple variations of mechanical combinations. In fact, permanently set for universal accommodations.

中文: 他的音阶有一个永久的共鸣音阶，设置在任何可能代表的质量和弦的第九个，任何和所有机械组合的多重变化上。事实上，永久设置为通用位置。

The next step is to establish pure harmony between the transmitter and the disintegrator, which is done by spinning the siren disk, then waiting until the sympathetic note is reached, as the siren chord, decreasing in velocity, descends the scale. At this juncture, the negative accelerator must be immediately and rapidly rotated, inducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the transmitter and the disintegrator by triple negative evolution, with the result that a force from five to ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty thousand pounds to the square inch is evolved by the focalization of this triple negative stream on the disintegrating cell, or chamber, whether there be one, two, three, five, or ten drops of water enclosed within it."

中文: 下一步是在发射器和分解器之间建立纯粹的和谐，这是通过旋转警笛盘来完成的，然后等待，直到达到共鸣音，随着警笛和弦的速度下降，音阶下降。此时，负加速器必须立即快速旋转，通过三重负演变引起传输器和崩解器之间的高度平衡紊乱，结果是，通过将三重负流聚焦在崩解室上，无论其中包有一滴、两滴、三滴、五滴或十滴水，都会产生从五到十、十五、二十和三万磅到平方英寸的力。”

"When moist air is subdivided by atomic vibration, the hydrogen is dissociated or separated from the oxygen but neither of them pass from the intermolecular state. Not until the intermolecular structure of hydrogen is subdivided by interatomic vibrations can it assimilate with the introductory etheric element."

中文: “当潮湿空⽓被原⼦振动细分时，氢与氧解离或分离，但它们都没有脱离分⼦间状态。直到氢的分⼦间结构被原⼦间振动细分时，它才能与引⼊的以太元素同化。 ”

"The latent force from liquids and gases differs from that liberated in metals in that it results from the breaking up of their rotating etheric envelopes, increasing simultaneously the range of their corpuscular action giving under confinement forces of almost infinite variety of pressures. When liberated from the tube it is confined in it seeks its medium of corresponding tenuity with a velocity exceeding that of light."

中文: 液体和气体的潜力与金属释放的潜力不同，因为它是由旋转的以太外壳破裂引起的，同时增加了它们在几乎无限多种压力的约束力下产生的微粒作用范围。当从管中释放出来时，它被限制在其中，以超过光速的速度寻找相应的稀薄介质

"The sympathetic neutral flow (from the molecular neutral centers to the mass neutral center) is the latent power liberated in the disintegration of water. In water this power is dispersive, liberating latent elastic energy, while in metals the latent force manifests itself only in negative attraction and when these vibrations are applied to minerals, there is evolved the primal ether which is dissipated, leaving behind only an impalpable intermolecular dust, in which is contained in virgin form an metals originally in the mineral mass."

中文: 交感中性流（从分子中性中心到质量中性中心）是水分解过程中释放出的势能。在水中，这种势能是分散的，释放出潜在的弹性能，而在金属中，这种势能只表现为负吸引。当这些振动施加到矿物上时，就产生了消散的原始以太，只留下一种摸不着的分子间尘埃，其中以原始形式含有矿物中最初的金属。

A non-intermittent flow of sympathy must flow along the Trexar, consisting of harmoniously adjusted thirds. Differential molecular weight is required, that is, the gas must contain heavy atoms and light atoms. This condition is satisfied by water, which consists of two light atoms of hydrogen and one heavy atom of oxygen. The oxygen atom weighs sixteen times as much as the hydrogen.

中文: 一股非间歇性的交感流必须沿着Trexar流动，由和谐调整的thirds组成。需要不同的分子量，即气体必须包含重原子和轻原子。水满足了这个条件，水由两个氢轻原子和一个氧重原子组成。氧原子的重量是氢原子的十六倍。

It is absolutely necessary to release the molecular ether by reducing the water to the interatomic state, before the atoms within the intermolecules can be released. Also the etheric capsules of the atomic and interatomic must be ruptured before the interatomic force can be produced. The ether from one subdivision is essential to subdividing the next higher.

中文: 在分子间的原子被释放之前，绝对有必要通过将水还原到原子间状态来释放分子以太。此外，在产生原子间力之前，原子和原子间的以太胶囊必须破裂。一个细分的以太对于下一个更高的细分是必不可少的。

Keely systemized the proper vibratory chords progressively, from the introductory molecular to the interetheric, embracing seven distinct orders of triple subdivision. He proved to his own satisfaction that progressive subdivision evolves new and distinct elements "too multiple to enumeate."

中文: 从入门分子到以太间，逐步地将正确的振动和弦系统化，包括七个不同的三重细分顺序。他满意地证明，渐进细分进化出新的、独特的元素“太多了，无法枚举”

Water is a ready and fit subject for vibratory research on account of its "differential volume" and gravity of its gases. Even on simple thirds the differential action between hydrogen and oxygen causes antagonism and dissociation. The differential of mass is such that the hydrogen and oxygen become thoroughly repellant and thereby exhibit thousands of times more force than could be induced by heat on the same amount of water. Vibration of antagonistic thirds, sixths and ninths on the mass chord will compel progressive subdivisions and to get the best effect on water, the instrument is set on all of these. First, the focalizing chord of sixths induces perfect harmony to the mass chord. Then the diatonic scale and enharmonic scale at the top of the instrument (or ring) is harmonized with the scale of the ninths at the base of his Trexar with the telephone transmitter. His next procedure was to disturb the harmony between the transmitter and disintegrator on the concentrative thirds or sixths, by rotating a siren. This he used to induce sympathetic communication along the Trexnonar between the vibrator and disintegrator. When the siren concorded to the neutral center it established the highest order of sympathy. He then operated the "transferable vibratory negatizer" or "vibratory accelerator" in the center of the "diatonic and enharmonic ring" at the top of the disintegrator and complete disintegration followed. The thirds first resolved the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, then the sixths resolved the hydrogen and oxygen into new elements by dissociation, producing "low atomic ether." Then the ninths resolved the low atomic ether into a new element or "high or sec- ond atomic harmonic." All these transmissions were simultaneous on the sympathetic equilibrium being disturbed by the negative accelerator.

中文: ⽔是振动研究的现成且合适的对象，因为它具有以下特点：“体积差”和⽓体的重⼒。即使在简单的thirds上，氢和氧之间的差异作用也会引起对抗和离解。质量差使得氢和氧变得完全排斥，从而表现出比在相同量的水上加热所产生的力大数千倍的力。质量弦上对抗性的thirds、sixths和ninths的振动将迫使进行细分，为了在水中获得最佳效果，乐器设置在所有这些之上。首先，sixths的聚焦和弦使大众和弦达到完美的和谐。然后，仪器（或环）顶部的全音音阶和增音音阶与电话发射机Trexar底部的九度音阶相协调。他的下一个步骤是通过旋转警报器，在集中的thirds或sixths处扰乱发射器和分解器之间的和谐。他用它来诱导振动器和崩解器之间沿着Trexnonar的交感联系。当警笛声向中立的中心响起时，它建立了最高级别的交感。然后，他在崩解器顶部的“全声和强声环”中心操作“可转移振动否定器”或“振动加速器”，随后完全崩解。thirds首先将水分子分解为氢和氧，然后sixths通过离解将氢和氧分解为新元素，产生“低原子以太”。然后ninths将低原子醚分解为新元素或“高或二次原子谐波”。所有这些传输都是在负加速器干扰的交感平衡上同时进行的。

Keely's first efforts toward disintegration of the elements of water were successful because of the differential weight of the respective atoms composing its molecules. Subsequently, he discovered that this same method, disintegration by differential mass, may be carried out with any gas, in other words, it must contain heavy atoms and light atoms. The heavy atom or oxygen in water weighs just sixteen times as much as either of the hydrogen atoms to which it is joined by chemical affinity.

中文: Keely第一次尝试分解水元素是成功的，因为组成其分子的各个原子的重量不同。随后，他发现，同样的方法，即差质量分解，可以对任何气体进行，换句话说，它必须包含重原子和轻原子。水中的重原子或氧的重量是通过化学亲和力连接的氢原子的十六倍。

"In the dissociation of water, molecular and intermolecular dissociation produces the first order of ozone, which is refreshing and vitalizing to breathe. Atomic and interatomic dissociation produces the second order of ozone, which is too pure to breathe, for it produces insensibility." The third order of ozone, produced by etheric and interetheric dissociation, Keely used in his "carbon register" to produce a high vibratory circuit to break up cohesion, which he recognized as molecular magnetism. It is possible that this "dissociation" in the "carbon register" depolarized the iron molecules by allowing the corpuscular outreach to return within the molecular embrace. The acceleration of vibration producing these different orders is governed by the introductory impulse and the subsequent chords, as arranged in his Liberator, by which he dissociated water. In molecular dissociation he used one fork of 620, setting chords on the first octave. In atomic separation, he used two forks, one of 620 and one of 630, setting chords on the second octave. In etheric separation he used three forks, one of 620, one of 630 and one of 12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.

“在水的离解过程中，分子和分子间离解产生一级臭氧，使人耳目一新，呼吸充满活力。原子和原子间离解产生二级臭氧，臭氧太纯净，无法呼吸，因为它会产生麻木感。”第三级臭氧由以太和以太间离解产生，Keely在他的“碳寄存器”中使用它来产生一个高振动回路，破坏内聚力，他认为这是分子磁性。这种在“碳寄存器”中的“解离”可能通过允许粒子外展回到分子怀抱中来使铁分子去极化。产生这些不同阶数的振动加速度由引入脉冲和随后的和弦决定，正如他在《解放者》中所安排的那样，他通过这些和弦离解水。在分子离解中，他使用了620的一个音叉，在第一个八度音阶上设置和弦。在原子分离中，他使用了两个叉子，一个620，一个630，在第二个八度音阶上设置和弦。在以太分离中，他使用了三个分叉，一个620，一个630和一个12000，将和弦设置在第三个八度音阶上。

"Not until the intermolecular structure of hydrogen is subdivided by interatomic vibrations, can it assimilate with the introductory etheric element."

“直到氢的分子间结构被原子间振动细分，它才能与引入的以太元素同化。”

Certain differential, dual, triple or quadruple chords act as an introductory impulse exciting action on molecular masses (liquid or gaseous) decreasing molecular oscillation. They are then in a receptive state for vibratory disintegration. The diatonic-enharmonic is sounded, increasing molecular oscillation. Molecular subdivision takes place when oscillation exceeds 50% of their diameters. (Molecular or intermolecular?) The gas is now molecularly subdivided and assumes a high velocity of rotation in any confining container, be it sphere or tube and becomes the medium or prepared subject for further disintegration. At this particular time Keely sought to further excite this preparatory medium by the use of an "illuminated revolving prism" a condenser (concave mirror or convex lens) and colored lenses, thereby giving the vibratory frequencies of their respective colors. In his disintegrator a glass tube of sufficient strength to withstand a pressure of 1000 Ibs. per square inch was arranged leading to the neutral center and the Trexar was attached to the external end of this glass tube. His use of this tube was probably also to convince the skeptics that the production of his power was genuine and possibly also was used to transmit color vibrations of such frequencies as to release the energy in the neutral center of the sphere.

某些微分、对偶、三弦或四弦对分子质量（液体或气体）起到引入脉冲激励作用，从而降低分子振荡。然后，它们处于振动解体的接受状态。全声增强音响起，增加分子振荡。当振荡超过其直径的50%时，分子发生细分。（分子还是分子间？）气体现在被分子细分，并在任何封闭容器（无论是球体还是管道）中呈现高速旋转，成为介质或准备进一步分解的对象。在这个特定的时刻，Keely试图通过使用“照明旋转棱镜”、聚光镜（凹面镜或凸面透镜）和彩色透镜来进一步激发这种预备介质，从而给出它们各自颜色的振动频率。在他的崩解器中有一个玻璃管，其强度足以承受1000磅的压力。每平方英寸布置成通向中性中心，并且Trexar连接到该玻璃管的外端。他使用这种管子可能也是为了说服怀疑论者，他的力量是真实的，也可能是用来传递这种频率的彩色振动，从而释放球体中性中心的能量。

When the triple introductory impulse or chords in three octaves, are transmitted to the disintegrator it SUBSERVES OR RENDERS NONOPERATIVE THE MOLECULAR CONCORDANT THIRDS AND ANTAGONIZES WITH DISCORDANT THIRDS, extending their range of oscillation and thereby inducing the highest degree of repellant antagonism or repulsion toward the neutral center of the sphere volume.

当三个八度音阶中的三个引入脉冲或和弦被传递到分解器时，分解器推动或提供不可操作的分子协调THIRDS和对抗的不协调THIRDS，扩大了它们的振荡范围，从而对球体体积的中性中心产生最高程度的排斥性对抗或排斥。

The etheric dominant or celestial current induces aqueous disintegration and thermal concentration which two prime conductors display a coincident chord of sympathy with the celestial current. These two prime conductors link the terrestrial to the celestial, without which electricity and magnetism would tend to become static or stable, all life and motion are governed by a dual power disturbance of equilibrium and sympathetic equation, both of which are in turn moved and regulated by electricity and magnetism.

以太主导流或天流引起水分解和热集中，分解与集中与天流表现出一致的共鸣。分解与集中将地球与天体连接起来，如果没有分解和集中，电和磁往往会变得静止或稳定，所有的生命和运动都受到平衡和共振方程的双功率扰动的控制，而这两个扰动又受到电和磁的运动和调节。

Progressive molecular and intermolecular dissociation reproduces on a small scale Nature's system of light production and also invariably results in vortex motion. All corpuscular action in Nature is vortex motion. The vortex action between the terrestrial and celestial streams, terrestrial condensation against solar tensions, shows conditions analogous to those displayed in the dissociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen, that is, vortex motion of the highest order, but peripheral only.

渐进的分子和分子间解离在小规模上再现了自然界的光产生系统，也总是导致涡旋运动。自然界中所有的微粒作用都是旋涡运动。陆地流和天体流之间的涡旋作用，即对抗太阳张力的陆地凝结，显示出与水分解成氢气和氧气类似的条件，即最高阶但仅为外围的涡旋运动。

EXAMPLE OF DISINTEGRATION

分解的例子

If the mass chord of the disintegrator is B flat, the resonators of that structure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave and B flat ninth octave, by drawing out the resonator caps and clamping the set screws. A simple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale at the head will determine by the tremulous action of the caps when exactly resonant. Neutral focalization is then established by dampening the steel rods on the back of the scale representing thirds, sixths, and ninths, by drawing a piece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the mass chord of the instrument. This effects concordance between the disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at baseof transmitter with telephone head.

如果分解器的质量弦是B平坦的，则通过拔出谐振器帽并夹紧固定螺钉，将该结构的谐振器设置在B平坦的第一倍频程、B平坦的第三倍频程和B平坦的九倍频程。手指在头部全音阶上的简单运动将取决于帽子在精确共振时的颤抖动作。然后，通过在代表三分之一、六分之一和九分之一的音阶背面润湿钢杆，在钢杆上画一根小胶管，建立中性聚焦，从而与乐器的质量和弦建立和谐。这影响了分解器和带电话头的发射机底部刻度的九分之一之间的一致性。

This instrument had a universal accommodator for all ninths in all multiple variations. This was possibly his sphere resonator.

这台仪器有一个通用的调节器，适用于所有多种变体的所有九分之一。这可能是他的球面谐振器。

Concordant harmony must now be established between the transmitter and the disintegrator by spinning the siren disk and waiting for the sympa- thetic note as its velocity decreases. As soon as this note sounds, the negative accelerator must be rapidly rotated inducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the disintegrator and the transmitter by triple negative evolution resulting in enormous pressure. By triple negative evolution he doubtless means disintegration to the etheric stage.

现在，发射器和分解器之间必须建立和谐的和谐，方法是旋转警笛盘，并随着速度的降低等待交感音。这个音符一响，负加速器就必须迅速旋转，通过三重负演化导致巨大的压力，从而引起崩解器和发射器之间的高度平衡扰动。通过三重负进化，他无疑意味着解体到以太阶段。
