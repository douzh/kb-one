# E.E.S. II背景信息和概念

E.E.S. II, BACKGROUND INFORMATION & CONCEPT

![](assets/c0007-01.png)

With alternating electrical current, electrons do not move from point "A" to point "B" as commonly envisioned! Electrical potential (oscillating electrons) at point "A", results in harmonic electron activity at point "B", when the grounding switch (circuit) is closed. That is to say, point "B" supplies it's own electrons and mirrors the activity of point "A". Impulsing (turbulence) by magnetic induction causes electrons to be pulled into the system, which then oscillates. When the magnetic field collapses (becomes absent) the electrical potential returns to it's natural background level.

使用交流电时，电子不会像通常想象的那样从点“A”移动到点“B”！当接地开关（电路）闭合时，点“A”处的电势（振荡电子）会导致点“B”处的谐波电子活动。也就是说，点“B”提供自己的电子，并反映点“A”的活动。磁感应的脉冲（湍流）导致电子被拉入系统，然后系统振荡。当磁场崩溃（消失）时，电势恢复到其自然背景水平。

Several major flaws are present in the conventional 60 cycles per second method of electrical power generation and it's iron core transformer system. This system is handcuffed by the inverse relationship of volts to amperes. This represents a stodgy, inflexible inheritance, courtesy of Mr. T.A. Edison and his concept of electrical power generation.

传统的每秒60次循环的发电方法及其铁芯变压器系统存在几个主要缺陷。这个系统被伏特与安培的反比关系所束缚。这代表了爱迪生先生及其发电概念的一种僵化、不灵活的继承。

Nikola Tesla stood, almost alone, against Edison and managed to prevail with his Alternating Current system. Without the alternating current system, electronic things in the modern sense would not exist.

尼古拉·特斯拉几乎独自一人对抗爱迪生，并凭借他的交流电系统取得了胜利。没有交流电系统，现代意义上的电子产品就不会存在。

This report will be concerned with some of the extensions and benefits of the alternating current electrical system. This study will limit it's scope to air core coil transformers at radio frequency and upwards. The electrical power produced by this method is inverted to Direct Current and then to Alternating Current as required for popular usage. There are several important advantages of this system over conventional power generation.

本报告将关注交流电系统的一些扩展和好处。本研究将把其范围限制在射频及以上的空心线圈变压器上。这种方法产生的电力被转换为直流电，然后根据大众使用的需要转换为交流电。与传统发电相比，该系统有几个重要优点。

Start with two coils (separate-apart), one being a reactor coil (L-1) and a second coil (L-2), being the reactant coil. Magnetic field fluxing (off-on of the electrical source) causes inductive reactance of L-1 which replicates by induction in L-2. Pulsing of the magnetic field (from L-1) in the presence of L-2, generates electrical potential. For example, should the L-1 coil have ten turns, with an imposed AC. potential of 1,200 volts. This results in each turn of L-1 acquiring 120 volts of potential. This induced magnetic field, then replicates itself in each turn of the L-2 coil. The L-2 coil may have one or many hundreds of turns. Modern encapsulation techniques makes high frequency and high energy controllable.

从两个线圈（分开）开始，一个是反应器线圈（L-1），另一个线圈（L-2）是反应物线圈。磁场通量（电源关闭-打开）导致L-1的电感电抗，该电抗在L-2中通过感应复制。在L-2存在的情况下，磁场（从L-1）的脉动会产生电势。例如，L-1线圈应该有十匝，施加1200伏的交流电势。这导致L-1的每一圈获得120伏的电势。然后，这种感应磁场在L-2线圈的每一圈中复制自己。L-2线圈可能有一圈或几百圈。现代封装技术使高频和高能可控。

Let's take another important step in this air-core transformer process. For purpose of discussion, let the value of inductive reactance at 60 cycles per second, equal one. Each time the frequency is doubled, the effectiveness of induction is squared. At about 20,000 Hz, when radio frequency is achieved, the electrons begin spinning free, outside of the inductor and they become increasingly free of the inverse relationship of volt-amperes. From this point on, they replicate by the inductive process as V.A.R.. That is to say, volts and amperes are equal, until resistance (work) is introduced. Therefore, additional, not previously available electrons become incorporated for a very large net gain in potential. This gain is real !

让我们在这个空心变压器过程中迈出另一个重要步骤。为了便于讨论，让每秒60个周期的电感电抗值等于1。每次频率加倍，感应的有效性都是平方。在大约20000 Hz的频率下，当达到射频时，电子开始在电感器外自由旋转，并且它们越来越不受伏安的反比关系的影响。从这一点开始，它们通过感应过程复制为V.A.R.。也就是说，在引入电阻（功）之前，伏特和安培是相等的。因此，额外的、以前不可用的电子被引入，从而获得了非常大的电势净增益。这个收获是真实的！

The quality of the grounding system determines the effectiveness of this method of producing electricity. A handy reference to locate the negative grounding areas for power generation can be found in the Aeromagnetic Map Studies of the US Geological Survey. They provide an excellent method for locating the best sites for optimum negative grounding areas.  When this method is combined with the induction coil system, already described, it provides an electrical power generating system millions of times more efficient than any known conventional method.

接地系统的质量决定了这种发电方法的有效性。在美国地质调查局的航磁图研究中可以找到一个方便的参考，用于定位发电的负极接地区域。它们为确定最佳负极接地区域的最佳位置提供了一种极好的方法。当这种方法与已经描述的感应线圈系统结合时，它提供了一种比任何已知的传统方法高效数百万倍的发电系统。

This new system ("E.E.S. II") is uncomplicated, physically small and it is inexpensive to build.  The technology required for it's construction already exists. Maintenance is near zero, as there are no moving parts. Once operating, this system could last forever.  Small mobile E.E.S. II units are already available as replacements for the batteries used in electric automobiles. Larger E.E.S. II units can be provided as a replacement source of power for hotels, office buildings, subdivisions, electric trains, manufacturing, heavy equipment, ships, and generally speaking, any present day application of electrical power.

这个新系统（“E.E.S.II”）结构简单，体积小，建造成本低。建造它所需的技术已经存在。由于没有活动部件，维护几乎为零。一旦运行，这个系统可以永远持续下去。小型移动E.E.S.II装置已经可以替代电动汽车中使用的电池。更大的E.E.S.II机组可以作为酒店、办公楼、分区、电动火车、制造业、重型设备、船舶以及一般来说任何当前电力应用的替代电源。
