A deep fog pervades the entire Scientific Community with regards to the Significance of the Above Energy Sources. Magnetic Waves convert directly into Electrical Waves (useful electricity). Two sides of the electromagnetic system are always present and never separate.  Local electron spin provides (action at a distance) the flip side of the incoming magnetic wave energy.

关于上述能源的意义，整个科学界笼罩着一层浓雾。磁波直接转化为电波（有用电）。电磁系统的两面总是存在的，永远不会分开。局域电子自旋提供了（远距离作用）入射磁波能量的翻转面。

Enormous amounts of incoming magnetic wave energy becomes a part of the Ambient Background, and as such, cannot be measured directly. Reconstruction from indirect information, allows us to establish the actual energy levels which are present. Instruments provided by the Scientific Community measure only point "A" to "B", and when both are ambient, no potential energy is shown. This is the "bird sitting on the million volt power line and sensing nothing" approach. The Earth's actual ambient background has as it's Energy level multi-billions of Volts, which are conveniently and obliviously ignored by the scientific community. When properly understood, this enormous, never-ending source of environmentally-friendly energy becomes available.

大量的入射磁波能量成为环境背景的一部分，因此无法直接测量。从间接信息中重建，使我们能够确定存在的实际能量水平。科学界提供的仪器只测量点“A”到“B”，当两者都是环境时，没有显示势能。这就是“鸟坐在百万伏的电力线上，什么也没感觉到”的方法。地球的实际环境背景具有数十亿伏特的能量水平，这被科学界方便而忽视了。如果理解得当，这种巨大的、永无止境的环保能源就会变得可用。

## 电能系统

Electrical Energy System

Don L. Smith, Energy Consultant

At a meeting between J.P. Morgan, Edison and Tesla, Tesla proposed an Electrical Energy System which could he connected into directly, without using a meter. Tesla's Idea of "Free Energy" was not compatible with their thinking. Courtesy of Morgan and Edison, from that day foreword, a complete and total bastardization of the Idea has been in progress. Agents for Morgan and Friends include the U.S. Patent Office and Academia. Academia's bad habit of incestuous quoting of each other, eliminates them as a possibility in cleaning up the mess. This selective ignorance, permeates throughout the study of electricity

在摩根大通、爱迪生和特斯拉的一次会议上，特斯拉提出了一种可以直接连接的电能系统，而无需使用电表。特斯拉的“自由能源”理念与他们的想法不相容。感谢摩根和爱迪生，从那天开始，这一理念被全面和彻底的篡改一直在进行中。摩根大通和他的伙伴的代理人包括美国专利局和学术界。学术界混乱引用彼此的坏习惯，消除了他们清理混乱的可能性。这种选择性的无知渗透到了整个电学研究中。

Many people, otherwise known as "intellectuals", have a total blackout and become jabbering idiots when "free-energy" is mentioned. The term has been amended to say, "something which was never there is being harvested and that this violates the laws of physics". For the selectively ignorant, this seems the way to run. Those who choose Morgan's drum beat, have severely limited the possibilities built into electricity.

许多人，也被称为“知识分子”，当提到“自由能源”时，他们完全失去了理智，变成了喋喋不休的白痴。该术语已被修改为“从未有过的东西正在被收获，这违反了物理定律”。对于有选择地无知的人来说，这似乎是逃跑的方式。那些选择摩根鼓声的人严重限制了电力的可能性。

This paper will be an exercise in creative understanding, in placing updated knowledge at your disposal. Whether it becomes a useful tool or is selectively ignored is your choice.

本文将是一个创造性理解的练习，将更新的知识交给你使用。它是成为一个有用的工具，还是被选择性地忽略，这是你的选择。

Electrons are defined as being the practical source of electrical and magnetic energy. The electron as a particle, was postulated by professor J. Thompson in early 1900's. It is now universally accepted that the electron exists and that it is the source of electricity. When the electron is agitated it produces magnetic and negative electrical energy. Physics as it exists today, cannot explain why the electron remains intact and is not diminished by the energy it releases. This is a part of the built-in ignorance provided by the Morgan and Edison Camp.

电子被定义为电能和磁能的实际来源。电子作为粒子，是由J.Thompson教授在20世纪初提出的。现在人们普遍认为电子存在并且是电的来源。当电子被搅动时，它会产生磁能和负电能。今天存在的物理学无法解释为什么电子保持完整，并且不会因其释放的能量而减少。这是摩根和爱迪生阵营提供的固有无知的一部分。

One volts worth of electrons, when cycled, yields one volts worth of electricity. This can be repeated continuously forever and it never deplete or diminishes the electrons in question. They simply return to their air and/or earth source, waiting to do the whole thing again and again.  Therefore, electrical energy is available, anywhere and everywhere humans go. People who intercede for profit, set the cost of electrical energy. Otherwise, all electrical energy is free, Morgan and Edison be damned.

一伏特的电子在循环时产生一伏特的电。这可以永远不断地重复，它永远不会耗尽或减少所讨论的电子。他们只是回到他们的空气和/或地球源头，等待一次又一次地做整件事。因此，无论人类走到哪里，电能都是可用的。那些为了利润而干预的人，设定了电能的成本。否则，所有的电能都是免费的，摩根和爱迪生该死。

Improving upon Professor Thompson's postulation, other obvious characteristics can be seen to further define the electron. It has both magnetic and electrical emanations resulting from a right-hand and left-hand spin. Since magnetism and amperage come as one package, this suggest, that electrons in their natural non-ionic state, exist as doublets. When pushed apart by agitation one spins and supplies electricity and the other spins and provides magnetic (amperage) energy. When they reunite, we have Volts x Amperage = Watts. This Idea, until now, has been totally absent from the knowledge base.

改进汤普森教授的假设，可以看到其他明显的特征来进一步定义电子。它具有由右手和左手旋转产生的磁和电辐射。由于磁性和安培数是一个整体，这表明，处于自然非离子状态的电子以双峰形式存在。当被搅拌推开时，一个旋转并提供电力，另一个旋转以提供磁能（安培数）。当它们重新结合时，我们得到伏特x安培数=瓦特。到目前为止，这个想法在知识库中完全缺失。

The number of times that an electron is cycled, sets the collective energy potential present. The electrical equivalent of $E = mC^2$ is $E = (Volts x Amperes) x (Cycles Per Second)^2$. Those who choose, are now free to head for the bushes and make their usual contribution to humanity.

电子循环的次数决定了存在的集体能量势。$E=mC^2$的电气等效值为$E=（伏特x安培）x（每秒循环数）^2$。那些选择的人现在可以自由地前往灌木丛，为人类做出他们通常的贡献。

Prior to Tesla, there was a large group of people in Europe, who were building resonant coil systems for medical use. Amperage was dangerous in their coil systems. The Tesla Coil is only the Voltage half of their coil system, as will be demonstrated. A short list of those (from 1860 onwards) active in resonate high frequency coil systems include; the Curies, Roentgen, Ruhmkoff, Oudin, Hertz, Levassor, Dumont, D'Arsonval and many others.

在特斯拉之前，欧洲有一大群人正在建造用于医疗用途的谐振线圈系统。电流在他们的线圈系统中是危险的。正如将要演示的那样，特斯拉线圈只是其线圈系统电压的一半。在谐振高频线圈系统中活跃的那些（从1860年起）的简短列表包括：居里、伦琴、鲁姆科夫、乌丁、赫兹、莱瓦索尔、杜蒙特、达松瓦尔和许多其他人。

Peugeot, Panhard-Levassor, Bollee, Renault and others had successful electric automobiles in production using A C. motors. Various electrically-powered airships, including the Dirigible "France" were in service.

标致、潘哈德·莱瓦索尔、博利、雷诺和其他公司已经成功生产了使用交流电机的电动汽车。包括“法国”号飞船在内的各种电动飞艇正在服役。

D'Arsonval, Professor of Experimental Medicine at the College of France, invented the electrocardiograph, oscilloscope, amp and volt meters, thermography and numerous other medical applications of high frequency electricity. As early as 1860, he was building high frequency coil systems, which he used in his experimental work. There is a strong connection between the work of Tesla and the people mentioned above.

法国学院实验医学教授D’Arsonval发明了心电图仪、示波器、安培和伏特表、热成像以及高频电的许多其他医学应用。早在1860年，他就在建造高频线圈系统，并将其用于他的实验工作中。特斯拉的工作与上述人之间有着很强的联系。

Electric vehicles of all sorts, dominated until the 1920s, when the electric starter motor made the internal combustion engine practical. Prior to that, upon cranking, it frequently would break the owner's arm. At that point the use of batteries as a source of power was replaced by oil.  The establishment's carpet has some rather large lumps under it. Coulomb's and Newton's inverse square law is politely ignored and it's opposite is allowed to have only the most abstract status. Without opposites we have no definition.

直到20世纪20年代，各种电动汽车一直占据主导地位，当时电动起动电机使内燃机变得实用。在此之前，在启动时，它经常会打断主人的手臂。那时，电池作为动力源的使用被石油所取代。当权者的地毯下面有一些相当大的块状物。库仑和牛顿的平方反比定律被礼貌地忽略了，它的对立面只被允许具有最抽象的地位。没有对立，我们就没有定义。

The source value of a remote flux reading, requires the squaring of the distance, times the remote reading, to obtain the original value. The opposite of this, being the derivations relate to Energy equals Mass times the Velocity constant squared. The electrical equivalent, being Energy equal capacitance times voltage squared and Energy equals induction times amperes squared. Flux lines increase as the law of squares and then activate electron energy which was not previously a part of the sum. The cumulative capacitance and inductance increase as the outer ends of a Tesla coil are approached, and this results in output energy being greater than the input energy present. This Energy is real. It can be safely measured by magnetic flux methods and electrostatic voltmeters, based on the inverse square law

远程通量读数的源值需要将距离乘以远程读数进行平方，以获得原始值。与此相反，导数与能量等于质量乘以速度常数的平方有关。电等效值，即能量等于电容乘以电压的平方，能量等于感应乘以安培的平方。通量线按照平方定律增加，然后激活以前不属于总和的电子能量。随着接近特斯拉线圈的外端，累积电容和电感增加，这导致输出能量大于存在的输入能量。这种能量是真实的。根据平方反比定律，它可以通过磁通量法和静电伏特计安全地测量

As seen above, flux lines result both from induction-henrys-amperage and capacitancecoulombs-volts, and define electrical energy. The non-linearity of this system does not obey Ohm's law, which is replaced with impedance and reactance for alternating current systems.  Impedance is the sum of the system's resistance to AC current flow, and this becomes zero at resonance. In resonant induction systems, a cycles-per-second increase, invokes a second round for the law of squares.

如上所述，磁通线由感应亨利电流和电容库仑伏特产生，并定义了电能。该系统的非线性不符合欧姆定律，对于交流系统，欧姆定律被阻抗和电抗所取代。阻抗是系统对交流电流的电阻之和，在谐振时变为零。在共振感应系统中，每秒增加一个周期，就会引发平方定律的第二轮。

The degree to which flux lines are present, disturbs an equal amount of electrons, upsetting the ambient background energy, resulting in useful electrical energy being obtained. The frequency at which the disturbance occurs, increases the useful energy available, and it obeys the law of squares. Two square-law components, flux density and frequency are involved. Enter resonance which cancels the resistive effect.

通量线存在的程度会干扰等量的电子，扰乱环境背景能量，从而获得有用的电能。扰动发生的频率增加了可用的有用能量，并且遵循平方定律。涉及两个平方律分量，即磁通密度和频率。进入谐振，消除电阻效应。

Only the electrical energy which is either above or below the ambient level is useful. For the Central U.S. going east to west, ambient as approximated by electro-static voltmeters and flux methods is 200,000 volts on a solar-quiet day. At night time, the ambient energy level drops to about one half of the daytime value. On a solar-active day, it may reach more than five times that of a solar-quiet day. Ambient background energy at the polar regions, is approximately 500,000 volts on a solar-quiet day. The background energy varies as it relates to the NorthSouth component and the East-West continuum.

只有高于或低于环境水平的电能是有用的。对于美国中部东西走向的地区，在太阳安静的日子里，静电伏特计和通量法估算的环境电压为200000伏。在夜间，环境能量水平降至白天值的一半左右。在太阳活动日，它可能达到太阳平静日的五倍多。在太阳安静的日子里，极地地区的环境背景能量约为50万伏。背景能量随着南北分量和东西连续体的变化而变化。

This leaves us with an interesting problem. Electrons, when disturbed, first produce magnetic flux and then produce electrical flux when they spin back to their normal position. Therefore any electron movement produces above ambient energy, being over unity.

这给我们留下了一个有趣的问题。电子在受到干扰时，首先产生磁通量，然后在自旋回到正常位置时产生电通量。因此，任何电子运动都会产生高于环境的能量，即超统一。
