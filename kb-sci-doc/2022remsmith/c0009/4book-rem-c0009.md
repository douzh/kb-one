描述

技术领域：

这项发明涉及加载偶极子天线系统及其电磁辐射。当作为一个带有适当的能源收集系统的变压器使用时，它变成一个转换器/发电机。本发明收集并转换那些在常规装置中被辐射和浪费的能量。

Background Art:

A search of the International Patent Database for closely related methods did not reveal any prior art with an interest in conserving radiated and wasted magnetic waves as useful energy.

技能背景:

搜索国际专利数据库以找到密切相关的方法，并没有显示出任何较早的技术对于可以保存辐射掉和浪费掉的磁波作为有用的能源感兴趣。

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION

The invention is a new and useful departure from transformer generator construction, such that radiated and wasted magnetic energy changes into useful electrical energy.  Gauss meters show that much energy from conventional electromagnetic devices is radiated into the ambient background and wasted. In the case of conventional transformer generators, a radical change in the physical construction allows better access to the energy available. It is found that creating a dipole and inserting capacitor plates at right angles to the current flow, allows magnetic waves to change back into useful electrical (coulombs) energy. Magnetic waves passing through the capacitor plates do not degrade and the full impact of the available energy is accessed. One, or as many sets of capacitor plates as is desired, may be used. Each set makes an exact copy of the full force and effect of the energy present in the magnetic waves. The originating source is not depleted of degraded as is common in conventional transformers.

发明的披露

本发明对传统变压器发电机结构是一个新的有益的逾越，以使那些辐射掉的和浪费掉的磁能转变成有用的电能。高斯计显示大量能量从传统电磁器件中辐射到周围背景并被浪费掉了。在传统变压器发电机的情况下，物理结构的根本改变使得我们有一个更好的入口去获取能源。我们发现创建一个偶极子并与电流成直角插入一块电容器极板，使得磁波变回有用的电（库伦）能。磁波通过电容器极板不仅不减低、还充分影响进入的有效能。可以使用一个、或一套或你想要用多少就可以用多少的电容器极板。每一套都精确复制了磁波里存在的能量的全部的力和效应。原始源泉不象传统变压器那样，而是永不枯竭退化的。

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

The Dipole at right angles, allows the magnetic flux surrounding it to intercept the capacitor plate, or plates, at right angles. The electrons present are spun such that the electrical component of each electron is collected by the capacitor plates. Essential parts are the South and North component of an active Dipole. Examples presented here exist as fully functional prototypes and were engineer constructed and fully tested in use by the Inventor. In each of the three examples shown in the drawings, corresponding parts are used.

BEST METHOD OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION

The invention is applicable to any and all electrical energy requirements. The small size and it's high efficiency make it an attractive option, especially for remote areas, homes, office buildings, factories, shopping centres, public places, transportation, water systems, electric trains, boats, ships and 'all things great and small'.

贯彻本装置的最佳方法

本发明适用于所有的电能需求。它小尺寸但高效率，令其成为很有吸引力的选择，特别是对边远地区、家庭、办公大楼、工厂、商业中心、公共场所、交通、水系统、电气火车、游艇、船舶和“所有或大或小的东西”。施工材料寻常可得，而制做设备只需中等技术水平。

2. 为应用而以设备和方法进行转换，通常消耗电磁能。

This patent does not make it clear that the device needs to be tuned and that the tuning is related to its physical location. The tuning will be accomplished by applying a variable-frequency input signal to the neon transformer and adjusting that input frequency to give the maximum output.

这项专利并没有解释设备是需要进行调整的；而调整与它的物理位置有关。调整的实现要通过应用变频输入信号给霓虹变压器来完成，并调节输入频率以给出最大输出。

Don Smith has produced some forty eight different devices, and because he understands that the real power in the universe is magnetic and not electric, these devices have performances which appear staggering to people trained to think that electrical power is the only source of power. One device which is commercially
produced in Russia, is shown here:

唐·史密斯已经生产了大约48种不同的设备，因为他知道宇宙中的真正力量是磁性的，而不是电性的，所以这些设备的性能对于那些受过训练认为电力是唯一动力来源的人来说似乎是惊人的。一种商业化的设备在俄罗斯生产的，如下图所示：

![](assets/c0009-05.png)

This is a small table-top device which looks like it is an experiment by a beginner, and something which would be wholly ineffective. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Each of the eight coils pairs (one each side of the rotating disc) produces 1,000 volts at 50 amps (fifty kilowatts) of output power, giving a total power output of 400 kilowatts. It's overall size is 16" x 14.5" x 10" (400 x 370 x 255 mm). In spite of the extremely high power output, the general construction is very simple:

这是一个小型桌面设备，看起来像是初学者的实验，而且完全无效。事实远非如此。八对线圈中的每一对（旋转盘的每侧一对）在50安培（50千瓦）的输出功率下产生1000伏的电压，总功率输出为400千瓦。它的整体尺寸为16英寸x14.5英寸x10英寸（400 x 370 x 255毫米）。尽管功率输出非常高，但总体结构非常简单：

![](assets/c0009-06.png)

The device operates on a fluctuating magnetic field which is produced by a small lowpower DC motor spinning a plastic disc. In the prototype shown above, the disc is anold vinyl record which has had holes cut in it. Between the holes is an area which was covered with glue and then sprinkled with powdered neodymium magnet material. It takes very little power to spin the disc, but it acts in a way which is very much like the Ecklin-Brown generator, repeatedly disrupting the magnetic field. The magnetic field is created by a neodymium magnet in each of the sixteen plastic pipes. It is important that the change in the magnetic flux between the matching magnets on each side of the disc is as large as possible. The ideal rotor material for this is "Terfenol-D" (tungsten zirconate) with slots cut in it but it is so expensive that materials like stainless steel are likely to be used instead

该装置在由旋转塑料盘的小型低功率直流电机产生的波动磁场中运行。在上图所示的原型中，光盘是一张阳极乙烯基唱片，上面开了孔。孔之间有一个区域，上面涂着胶水，然后撒上粉末钕磁铁材料。旋转圆盘只需要很小的能量，但它的作用方式非常像埃克林-布朗发电机，反复扰乱磁场。磁场是由十六个塑料管中的每一个中的钕磁体产生的。重要的是，圆盘两侧匹配磁体之间的磁通量变化应尽可能大。理想的转子材料是“Terfenol-D”（锆酸钨），上面有槽，但它太贵了，可能会使用不锈钢等材料代替

For Don Smith, this is not an exceptional device. The one shown below is also physically quite small and yet it has an output of 160 kilowatts (8000 volts at 20 amps) from an input of 12 volts 1 amp (COP = 13,333):

下面所示装置体型相当小，可以具有160千瓦的输出（8000伏20安培），而输入为12伏1安培（COP=13.333）

Again, this is a device which can be placed on top of a table and is not a complicated form of construction, having a very open and simplistic layout. However, some components are not mounted on this board. The twelve volt battery and connecting leads are not shown, nor is the ground connection, the step-down isolation transformer and the varistor used to protect the load from over-voltage by absorbing any random voltage spikes which might occur, but more of these things later on when a much more detailed description of this device is given.

同样，这是一种可以放置在桌子上的设备，结构并不复杂，布局非常开放和简单。但是，有些组件没有安装在此板上。未显示12伏电池和连接引线，也未显示接地连接、降压隔离变压器和变阻器，变阻器用于通过吸收可能出现的任何随机电压尖峰来保护负载免受过电压，但稍后将对该设备进行更详细的描述。

Another of Don's devices is shown here:

唐的另一个设备如下：

![](assets/c0009-08.png)

This is a larger device which uses a plasma tube four feet (1.22 m) long and 6 inches (100 mm) in diameter. The output is a massive 100 kilowatts. This is the design shown as one of the options in Don's patent. Being an Electrical Engineer, none of Don's prototypes are in the "toy" category. If nothing else is taken from Don's work, we should realise that high power outputs can be had from very simple devices.

这是一个更大的装置，它使用一根四英尺（1.22米）长、直径6英寸（100毫米）的等离子管。输出功率高达100千瓦。这是唐专利中显示的选项之一。作为一名电气工程师，唐的原型都不属于“玩具”类别。如果不从唐的工作中吸取任何其他东西，我们应该意识到，可以从非常简单的设备中获得高功率输出。

There is one other brief document "Resonate Electrical Power System" from Don Smith which says:

Don Smith的另一份简短文件“谐振电力系统”说：

Potential Energy us everywhere at all times, becoming useful when converted into a more practical form. There is no energy shortage, only grey matter. This energy potential is observed indirectly through the manifestation of electromagnetic phenomenon, when intercepted and converted, becomes useful. In nonlinear systems, interaction of magnetic waves amplify (conjugate) energy, providing greater output than input. In simple form, in the piano where three strings are struck by the hammer, the centre one is impacted and resonance activates the side strings. Resonance between the three strings provides a sound level greater than the input energy. Sound is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and is subject to all that is applicable to it.

势能无时无处不在，当转换为更实用的形式时就成为有益的了。只要用脑，就没有能源短缺。这种潜在的能量是通过电磁现象的表现间接观察到的——当被截获和转换，变得有用时。在非线性系统中，磁波的相互作用放大(共轭)能源，提供比输入更大的输出。简单地说，锤击钢琴的三条弦，中间的一条遭到撞击而共鸣并激活两侧的弦。三条弦的共鸣产生一个大于输入能量的声级。声音是电磁波频谱的一部分，并遵守所有适用律。

"Useful Energy" is defined as "that which is other than Ambient". "Electric Potential" relates to mass and it's acceleration. Therefore, the Earth's Mass and Speed through space, gives it an enormous electrical potential. Humans are like the bird sitting unaware on a high voltage line. in nature, turbulence upsets ambient and we seeelectrical displays. Tampering with ambient, allows humans to convert magnetic waves into useful electricity.

“有用能源”被定义为“除了环境以外的能源”。“电势”与质量及其加速度有关。因此，地球的质量和速度穿过空间，给它一个巨大的电势。人类就像坐在高压线上而没有意识到的鸟。在自然界，湍流扰乱环境而我们看到电的显露。篡改环境，使得人类能够把磁波转化为有用的电能。

Putting this in focus, requires a look at the Earth in general. Each minute of each day (1,440 minutes), more than 4,000 displays of lightning occur. Each display yields more than 10,000,000 volts at more than 200,000 amperes in equivalent electromagnetic flux. This is more than 57,600,000,000,000 volts and 1,152,000,000,000 amperes of electromagnetic flux during each 24 hour period. This has been going on for more than 4 billion years. The USPTO insist that the Earth's electrical field is insignificant and useless, and that converting this energy violates the laws of nature. At the same time, they issue patents in which, electromagnetic flux coming in from the Sun is converted by solar cells into DC energy. Aeromagnetic flux (in gammas) Maps World-Wide, includes those provided by the US Department of Interior-Geological Survey, and these show clearly that there is present, a spread of 1,900 gamma above Ambient, from reading instruments flown 1,000 feet above the (surface) source. Coulomb's Law requires the squaring of the distance of the remote reading, multiplied by the recorded reading. Therefore, that reading of 1,900 gamma has a corrected value of 1,900 x 1,000 x 1,000 = 1,900,000,000 gamma.

以此为重点，一般要看看地球。在每天的1,440分钟里，发生4,000多次闪电。每次闪电收获超过千万伏特20万安培的相当电磁流量。这是每24小时周期里超过57,600,000,000,000伏和1,152,000,000,000安培的电磁流量。这已经持续了超过40亿年。美国专利商标局坚持认为，地球的电场是微不足道的和无用的，而这种能量转化违反自然规律。同时，他们发布的专利中，就有来自太阳的电磁流量由太阳能电池转化成直流能源。世界航空磁测通量（伽马能谱）图，包括那些由美国内部地质勘测部门提供的，这些都清楚地表明，从飞临（表面）源1000英尺以上的指示仪表上可知，存在一个在环境之上1,900伽马的分布。库仑定律需要距离平方的远程读数，乘以记录读数。因此，1900伽玛的读数校正值是1900x1000x1000=1,900,000,000伽马。

There is a tendency to confuse "gamma ray" with "gamma". "Gamma" is ordinary, everyday magnetic flux, while "gamma ray" is high-impact energy and not flux. One gamma of magnetic flux is equal to that of 100 volts RMS. To see this, take a Plasma Globe emitting 40,000 volts. When properly used, a gamma meter placed nearby, will read 400 gammas. The 1,900,000,000 gamma just mentioned, is the magnetic ambient equivalent of 190,000,000 volts of electricity. This is on a "Solar Quiet" day.  On "Solar Active" days it may exceed five times that amount. The Establishment's idea that the Earth's electrical field is insignificant, goes the way of their other great ideas.

有一种混淆“伽玛”和“伽玛射线”的倾向。“伽玛”是普通的日常磁通量，而“伽玛射线”是高冲击强度的能量而不是通量。一伽玛等于100伏均方根值。若要看到这一点，采取等离子球发射40000伏特。当正确使用时，一台放置在附近的伽马仪将读取到400伽玛。刚说到的1,900,000,000伽马，是相当于190,000,000伏电力的磁环境。这是“太阳安静”的一天。在“太阳活跃”日，将是上述数字的五倍。当局的地球电场是微不足道的观念，重蹈了他们其它的伟大理念的覆辙。

There are two kinds of electricity: "potential" and "useful". All electricity is "potential" until it is converted. The resonant-fluxing of electrons, activates the electrical potential which is present everywhere. The Intensity/CPS of the resonant-frequency-flux rate, sets the available energy. This must then be converted into the required physical dimensions of the equipment being used. For example, energy arriving from the Sun is magnetic flux, which solar cells convert to DC electricity, which is then converted further to suit the equipment being powered by it. Only the magnetic flux moves from point "A" (the Sun) to point "B" (the Earth). All electrical power systems work in exactly the same way. Movement of Coils and Magnets at point "A" (the generator) fluxes electrons, which in turn, excite electrons at point "B" (your house). None of the electrons at point "A" are ever transmitted to point "B". In both cases, the electrons remain forever intact and available for further fluxing. This is not allowed by Newtonian Physics (electrodynamics and the laws of conservation). Clearly, these laws are all screwed up and inadequate.

有两种电能，“潜能”和“有用能”。所有电能都是“潜能”，直至它们被转换。电子的共振流通激活了无处不在的电子潜能。共振频率通流率的强度/CPS(每秒电子数)，设置可用的能源。这必须被转换成正在使用的设备所需的物理尺寸。例如，来自太阳的能量是磁通量，由太阳能电池转换成直流电，然后进一步转换成适于它所提供能量的设备的形式。只有磁通从点“A”（太阳）转移到点“B”（地球）。所有电能系统的工作方式完全相同。线圈和磁体的运动在点“A”（发电机）流动电子，继而激发在点“B”（你的住宅）的电子。根本没有点“A”的电子源源不断地传送到点“B”。在这两种情况下，电子永远保持完整无损，并且可用于进一步通流。这是牛顿物理（电气力学和守恒定律）所不允许的。显然，这些定律把人搞糊涂了而且是不充足的。

In modern physics, USPTO style, all of the above cannot exist because it opens a door to overunity. The good news is that the PTO has already issued hundreds of Patents related to Light Amplification, all of which are overunity. The Dynode used to adjust the self-powered shutter in your camera, receives magnetic flux from light which dislodges electrons from the cathode, reflecting electrons through the dynode bridgeto the anode, resulting in billions of more electrons out than in. There are currently, 297 direct patents issued for this system, and thousands of peripheral patents, all of which support overunity. More than a thousand other Patents which have been issued, can be seen by the discerning eye to be overunity devices. What does this indicate about Intellectual Honesty?

在现代物理学中，美国专利商标局风格，上述所有都不可能存在，因为它为超一打开了一扇门。好消息是，美国专利商标局已经颁发了数百项与光放大相关的专利，所有这些专利都超一。Dynode用于调节相机中的自供电快门，它接收来自光的磁通量，将电子从阴极移开，通过Dynode桥将电子反射到阳极，导致出射的电子比入射的电子多数十亿。目前，该系统已获得297项直接专利和数千项外围专利，所有这些专利都支持超一。已经颁发的一千多项其他专利，可以用敏锐的眼光看出是超一的设备。这表明了什么是聪明的诚实？

Any coil system, when fluxed, causes electrons to spin and produce useful energy, once it is converted to the style required by its use. Now that we have described the method which is required, let us now see how this concerns us.

任何线圈系统在通电时，一旦转换为使用所需的样式，就会使电子自旋并产生有用的能量。既然我们已经描述了所需的方法，现在让我们看看这与我们有什么关系。

The entire System already exists and all that we need to do is to hook it up in a way which is useful to our required manner of use. Let us examine this backwards and start with a conventional output transformer. Consider one which has the required voltage and current handling characteristics and which acts as an isolation transformer. Only the magnetic flux passes from the input winding to the output winding. No electrons pass through from the input side to the output side. Therefore, we only need to flux the output side of the transformer to have an electrical output.  Bad design by the establishment, allowing hysteresis of the metal plates, limits the load which can be driven. Up to this point, only potential is a consideration. Heat (which is energy loss) limits the output amperage. Correctly designed composite cores run cool, not hot.

整个系统已存在，而所有我们需要做的是按我们的使用方式而组合成对我们有用的。让我们回过头来审核这一点并以一台传统输出变压器开始。考虑一台拥有所需的电压和电流处理特性并起隔离变压器作用的设备。从输入绕组到输出绕组只有磁通通过。输入端到输出端没有电子通过。所以，我们只需要通流变压器的输出端以得到一个电输出。主流的设计很糟糕，允许金属板的磁滞，限制了可以被驱动的负载。到目前为止，只有潜能是一个考虑因素。热量（这是能量损失）限制输出电流强度。正确的设计应该是复合芯变冷而不是发热。

A power correction factor system, being a capacitor bank, maintains an even flow of flux. These same capacitors, when used with a coil system (a transformer) become a frequency-timing system. Therefore, the inductance of the input side of the transformer, when combined with the capacitor bank, provides the required fluxing to produce the required electrical energy (cycles per second).

一个功率校正因数系统，以一个电容器组，保持一个平均流量的通量。这些相同的电容器，当用于一个线圈系统时（一台变压器）就成为变频调速系统。因此，变压器的输入端的自感应，当与电容器组结合，给出需要的通量去产生所需要的电能（每秒周期数）。

With the downstream system in place, all that is needed now is a potential system.  Any flux system will be suitable. Any amplification over-unity output type is desirable.  The input system is point "A" and the output system is point "B". Any input system where a lesser amount of electrons disturbs a greater amount of electrons - producing an output which is greater than the input - is desirable.

把下游系统放在适当位置，现在所需要的只是一个势能系统。任何通量系统都将是适宜的。任意放大“超统一体”的输出的类型都是可取的。输入系统是点“A”而输出系统是点“B”。任何输入系统中一个较少量的电子干扰数量较多的电子而产生的一个输出，既输出大于输入，是可取的。

At this point, it is necessary to present updated information about electrons and the laws of physics. A large part of this, originates from me and so is likely to upset people who are rigidly set in the thought patterns of conventional science.

在这点上，有必要呈上有关电子和物理定律的修正信息。在这点上，有必要提供有关电子和物理定律的最新的信息。这一点，很大一部分源自我(唐·史密斯），因而很可能会使那些硬性思考传统科学模式的人心烦意乱。

## 非离子电子

As a source of electrical energy, non-ionic electrons doublets exist in immense quantities throughout the universe. Their origin is from the emanation of Solar Plasma.  When ambient electrons are disturbed by being spun or pushed apart, they yield both magnetic and electrical energy. The rate of disturbance (cycling) determines the energy level achieved. Practical methods of disturbing them include, moving coils past magnets or vice versa. A better way is the pulsing (resonant induction) with magnetic fields and waves near coils.

作为电能的来源，整个宇宙中存在大量的非离子电子偶。它们的起源是太阳等离子体的发射。当周围的电子被旋转或推开而受到干扰时，它们会产生磁能和电能。干扰（循环）的速率决定了达到的能级。干扰它们的实用方法包括将线圈移过磁铁，反之亦然。更好的方法是在线圈附近用磁场和波进行脉冲（共振感应）。

In coil systems, magnetic and amperage are one package. This suggests that electrons in their natural non-ionic state, exist as doublets. When pushed apart by agitation, one spins right (yielding Volts-potential electricity) and the other spins left (yielding Amperage-magnetic energy), one being more negative than the other. This further suggests that when they reunite, we have (Volts x Amps = Watts) useful electrical energy. Until now, this idea has been totally absent from the knowledge base. The previous definition of Amperage is therefore flawed.

在线圈系统中，磁场和电流是一个整体。这表明，处于自然非离子状态的电子以双峰形式存在。当被搅拌推开时，一个向右旋转（产生伏特电势），另一个向左旋转（产生安培磁能），一个比另一个更负。这进一步表明，当它们重新结合时，我们拥有（伏特x安培=瓦特）有用的电能。到目前为止，这一想法在知识库中完全缺失。因此，之前对安培的定义是有缺陷的。

有用电路，对建造一台可运行单元的建议

![](assets/c0009-11.png)

1. Substitute a Plasma Globe such as Radio Shack's "Illumna-Storm" for thesource-resonant induction system. It will have about 400 milligauss of magnetic induction. One milligauss is equal to 100 volts worth of magnetic induction.  2. Construct a coil using a 5-inch to 7-inch (125 to 180 mm) diameter piece of PVC for the coil former.
3. Get about 30 feet (10 m) of Jumbo-Speaker Cable and separate the two strands. This can be done by sticking a carpet knife into a piece of cardboard or wood, and then pulling the cable carefully past the blade to separate the two insulated cores from each other. (PJK Note: "Jumbo-Speaker Cable" is a vague term as that cable comes in many varieties, with anything from a few, to over 500 strands in each core. As Don points out that the output power increases with each turn of wire, it is distinctly possible that each of these strands acts the same as individual insulated turns which have been connected in parallel, so a 500-strand cable may well be far more effective than a cable with just a few strands).
4. Wind the coil with 10 to 15 turns of wire and leave about 3 feet (1 m) of cable spare at each end of the coil. Use a glue gun to hold the start and finish of the coil.
5. This will become the "L - 2" coil shown in the Circuits page.
6. When sitting on top of the Plasma Globe (like a crown) you have a first-class resonant air-core coil system.
7. Now, substitute two or more capacitors (rated at 5,000 volts or more) for the capacitor bank shown on the Circuits page. I use more than two 34 microfarad capacitors.
8. Finish out the circuit as shown. You are now in business !
9. Voltage - Amperage limiting resistors are required across the output side of the Load transformer. These are used to adjust the output level and the desired cycles per second.

Suggestions: Get a copy of the "Handbook of Electronic Tables and Formulas",
published by Sams, ISBN 0-672-22469-0, also an LCR meter is required. Chapter 1 in
this book has important time constant (frequency) information and a set of reactance
charts in nomograph style ("nomograph": a graph, usually containing three parallel
scales graduated for different variables so that when a straight line connects values of
any two, the related value may be read directly from the third at the point intersected
by the line) which makes working, and approximating of the three variables
(capacitance, inductance and resistance) much easier. If two of the variables are
known, then the third one can be read from the nomograph.

For example, if the input side of the isolation transformer needs to operate at 60 Hz,
that is 60 positive cycles and 60 negative cycles, being a total of 120 cycles. Read off
the inductance in Henries using the LCR meter attached to the input side of the
isolation transformer. Plot this value on the (nomographic) reactance chart. Plot the
needed 120 Hz on the chart and connect these two points with a straight line. Where
this line crosses the Farads line and the Ohms line, gives us two values. Choose one
(resistor) and insert it between the two leads of the transformer input winding.

The Power Correction Factor Capacitor (or bank of more than one capacitor) now
need adjusting. The following formula is helpful in finding this missing information. The
capacitance is known, as is the desired potential to pulse the output transformer. One
Farad of capacitance is one volt for one second (one Coulomb). Therefore, if we want
to keep the bucket full with a certain amount, how many dippers full are needed? If the
bucket needs 120 volts, then how many coulombs are required?

    Desired Voltage/Capacitance in Microfarads = Required frequency in Hz

    所需电压/电容量(微法) = 所需频率(赫效)

Now, go to the Reactance Chart mentioned above, and find the required resistor
jumper to place between the poles of the Correction Factor Capacitor.

A earth grounding is desirable as a voltage-limiter and transient spike control. Two are
necessary, one at the Power Factor Capacitor and one at the input side of the isolation
transformer. Off-the-shelf surge arrestors / spark gaps and varistors having the desired
voltage/potential and amperage control are commonly available. Siemans, Citel
America and others, make a full range of surge arrestors, etc. Varistors look like coinsized flat capacitors. Any of these voltage limiters are marked as "V - 1" in the
following text.


It should be obvious that several separate closed circuits are present in the suggested
configuration: The power input source, the high-voltage module, a power factor
capacitor bank combined with the input side of the isolation transformer. Lastly, the
output side of the isolation transformer and its load. None of the electrons active at the
power source (battery) are passed through the system for use downstream. At any
point, if the magnetic flux rate should happen to vary, then the number of active
electrons also varies. Therefore, controlling the flux rate controls the electron
(potential) activity. Electrons active at point "A" are not the same electrons active at
point "B", or point "C", and so on. If the magnetic flux rate (frequency Hz) varies, then
a different number of electrons will be disturbed. This does not violate any Natural Law
and does produce more energy out than in should that be desirable.

A convenient high-voltage module is a 12 volt DC neon tube transformer. The Power
Factor Correction Capacitors should be as many microfarads as possible as this
allows a lower operating frequency. The 12-volt neon tube transformer oscillates at
about 30,000 Hz. At the Power Correction Factor Capacitor bank we lower the
frequency to match the input side of the isolation transformer.

Other convenient high-voltage sources are car ignition coils, television flyback
transformers, laser printer modules, and various other devices. Always lower the
frequency at the Power Factor Correction Capacitor and correct, if needed, at the input
side of the isolation transformer. The isolation transformer comes alive when pulsed.
Amperage becomes a part of the consideration only at the isolation transformer. Faulty
design, resulting in hysteresis, creates heat which self-destructs the transformer if it is
overloaded. Transformers which have a composite core instead of the more common
cores made from many layers of thin sheets of soft iron, run cool and can tolerate
much higher amperage.

The information shown above, relates to the small Suitcase Model demonstrated at
the 1996 Tesla Convention, presented as Don Smiths' Workshop. This unit was a very
primitive version and newer versions have atomic batteries and power output ranges
of Gigawatts. The battery requirement is low level and is no more harmful than the
radium on the dial of a clock. Commercial units of Boulder Dam size are currently
being installed at several major locations throughout the world. For reasons of Don's
personal security and contract obligations, the information which he has shared here is
incomplete.

I am most definitely not an expert in this area. However, it is probably worth
mentioning some of the main points which Don Smith appears to be making. There
are some very important points being made here, and grasping these may make a
considerable difference to our ability to tap into the excess energy available in our
local environment. There are four points worth mentioning:

1. Voltage
2. Frequency
3. Magnetic / Electric relationship
4. Resonance

1. Voltage. We tend to view things with an 'intuitive' view, generally based on fairly
simple concepts. For example, we automatically think that it is more difficult to pick up
a heavy object than to pick up a light one. How much more difficult? Well, if it is twice
as heavy, it would probably be about twice as much effort to pick it up. This view has
developed from our experience of things which we have done in the past, rather than
on any mathematical calculation or formula.

Well, how about pulsing an electronic system with a voltage? How would the output
power of a system be affected by increasing the voltage? Our initial 'off-the cuff'
reaction might be that the power output might be increased a bit, but then hold on…
we've just remembered that Watts = Volts x Amps, so if you double the voltage, then
you would double the power in watts. So we might settle for the notion that if we
doubled the voltage then we could double the output power. If we thought that, then
we would be wrong.

Don Smith points out that as capacitors and coils store energy, if they are involved in
the circuit, then the output power is proportional to the square of the voltage used.
Double the voltage, and the output power is four times greater. Use three times the
voltage and the output power is nine times greater. Use ten times the voltage and the
output power is one hundred times greater !

![](assets/c0009-18.png)

Don says that the energy stored, multiplied by the cycles per second, is the energy
being pumped by the system. Capacitors and inductors (coils) temporarily store
electrons, and their performance is given by:

Capacitor formula: $W = 0.5 x C x V^2 x Hz$ where:

    W is the energy in Joules (Joules = Volts x Amps x seconds)
    C is the capacitance in Farads
    V is the voltage
    Hz is the cycles per second

Inductor formula: $W = 0.5 x L x A^2 x Hz$ where

    W is the energy in Joules
    L is the inductance in Henrys
    A is the current in amps
    Hz is the frequency in cycles per second

You will notice that where inductors (coils) are involved, then the output power goes up
with the square of the current. Double the voltage and double the current gives four
times the power output due to the increased voltage and that increased output is
increased by a further four times due to the increased current, giving sixteen times the
output power.

2. Frequency. You will notice from the formulas above, that the output power is
directly proportional to the frequency "Hz". The frequency is the number of cycles per
second (or pulses per second) applied to the circuit. This is something which is not
intuitive for most people. If you double the rate of pulsing, then you double the power
output. When this sinks in, you suddenly see why Nikola Tesla tended to use millions
of volts and millions of pulses per second.

However, Don Smith states that when a circuit is at it's point of resonance, resistance
in the circuit drops to zero and the circuit becomes effectively, a superconductor. The
energy for such a system which is in resonance is:

Resonant circuit: $W = 0.5 x C x V^2 x (Hz)^2$ where:

    W is the energy in Joules
    C is the capacitance in Farads
    V is the voltage
    Hz is the cycles per second

If this is correct, then raising the frequency in a resonating circuit has a massive effect
on the power output of the device. The question then arises: why is the mains power in
Europe just fifty cycles per second and in America just sixty cycles per second? If
power goes up with frequency, then why not feed households at a million cycles per
second? One major reason is that it is not easy to make electric motors which can be
driven with power delivered at that frequency, so a more suitable frequency is chosen
in order to suit the motors in vacuum cleaners, washing machines and other
household equipment.

However, if we want to extract energy from the environment, then we should go for
high voltage and high frequency. Then, when high power has been extracted, if we
want a low frequency suited to electric motors, we can pulse the already captured
power at that low frequency.

It might be speculated that if a device is being driven with sharp pulses which have a
very sharply rising leading edge, that the effective frequency of the pulsing is actually
determined by the speed of that rising edge, rather than the rate at which the pulses
are actually generated. For example, if pulses are being generated at, say, 50 kHz but
the pulses have a leading edge which would be suited to a 200 kHz pulse train, then
the device might well see the signal as a 200 kHz signal with a 25% Mark/Space ratio,
the very suddenness of the applied voltage having a magnetic shocking effect
equivalent to a 200 kHz pulse train.

3. Magnetic / Electric relationship. Don states that the reason why our present
power systems are so inefficient is because we concentrate on the electric component
of electromagnetism. These systems are always COP<1 as electricity is the 'losses' of
electromagnetic power. Instead, if you concentrate on the magnetic component, then
there is no limit on the electric power which can be extracted from that magnetic
component. Contrary to what you might expect, if you install a pick-up system which
extracts electrical energy from the magnetic component, you can install any number of
other identical pick-ups, each of which extract the same amount of electrical energy
from the magnetic input, without loading the magnetic wave in any way. Unlimited
electrical output for the 'cost' of creating a single magnetic effect.

The magnetic effect which we want to create is a ripple in the zero-point energy field,
and ideally, we want to create that effect while using very little power. Creating a dipole
with a battery which has a Plus and a Minus terminal or a magnet which has North and
South poles, is an easy way to do create an electromagnetic imbalance in the local
environment. Pulsing a coil is probably an even better way as the magnetic field
reverses rapidly if it is an air-core coil, such as a Tesla Coil. Using a ferromagnetic
core to the coil can create a problem as iron can't reverse it's magnetic alignment very
rapidly, and ideally, you want pulsing which is at least a thousand times faster than
iron can handle.

Don draws attention to the "Transmitter / Receiver" educational kit "Resonant Circuits
#10-416" supplied by The Science Source, Maine. This kit demonstrates the
generation of resonant energy and it's collection with a receiver circuit. However, ifseveral receiver circuits are used, then the energy collected is increased several times
without any increase in the transmitted energy. This is similar to a radio transmitter
where hundreds of thousands of radio receivers can receive the transmitted signal
without loading the transmitter in any way.

This immediately makes the Hubbard device spring to mind. Hubbard has a central
"electromagnetic transmitter" surrounded by a ring of "receivers" closely coupled
magnetically to the transmitter, each of which will receive a copy of the energy sent by
the transmitter:

![](assets/c0009-19.png)

Don points to an even more clearly demonstrated occurrence of this effect in the Tesla
Coil. In a typical Tesla Coil, the primary coil is much larger diameter than the inner
secondary coil:

![](assets/c0009-20.png)

If, for example, 8,000 volts is applied to the primary coil which has four turns, then
each turn would have 2,000 volts of potential. Each turn of the primary coil transfers
electromagnetic flux to every single turn of the secondary winding, and the secondary
coil has a very large number of turns. Massively more power is produced in the
secondary coil than was used to energise the primary coil. A common mistake is to
believe that a Tesla Coil can't produce serious amperage. If the primary coil is
positioned in the middle of the secondary coil as shown, then the amperage generated
will be as large as the voltage generated. A low power input to the primary coil can
produce kilowatts of usable electrical power as described in chapter 5.

4. Resonance. An important factor in circuits aimed at tapping external energy is
resonance. It can be hard to see where this comes in when it is an electronic circuitwhich is being considered. However, everything has it's own resonant frequency,
whether it is a coil or any other electronic component. When components are
connected together to form a circuit, the circuit has an overall resonant frequency. As a
simple example, consider a swing:

![](assets/c0009-21.png)

If the swing is pushed before it reaches the highest point on the mother's side, then
the push actually detracts from the swinging action. The time of one full swing is the
resonant frequency of the swing, and that is determined by the length of the
supporting ropes holding the seat and not the weight of the child nor the power with
which the child is pushed. Provided that the timing is exactly right, a very small push
can get a swing moving in a substantial arc. The key factor is, matching the pulses
applied to the swing, to the resonant frequency of the swing. Get it right and a large
movement is produced. Get it wrong, and the swing doesn't get going at all (at which
point, critics would say "see, see …swings just don't work - this proves it !!").

Establishing the exact pulsing rate needed for a resonant circuit is not particularly
easy, because the circuit contains coils (which have inductance, capacitance and
resistance), capacitors (which have capacitance and a small amount of resistance)
and resistors and wires, both of which have resistance and some capacitance. These
kinds of circuit are called "LRC" circuits because "L" is the symbol used for
inductance, "R" is the symbol used for resistance and "C" is the symbol used for
capacitance.

Don Smith provides instructions for winding and using the type of air-core coils needed
for a Tesla Coil. He says:

1. Decide a frequency and bear in mind, the economy of the size of construction
selected. The factors are:

(a) Use radio frequency (above 20 kHz).
(b) Use natural frequency, i.e. match the coil wire length to the frequency - coils
have both capacitance and inductance.
(c) Make the wire length either one quarter, one half or the full wavelength.
(d) Calculate the wire length in feet as follows:
If using one quarter wavelength, then divide 247 by the frequency in MHz.
If using one half wavelength, then divide 494 by the frequency in MHz.
If using the full wavelength, then divide 998 by the frequency in MHz.
For wire lengths in metres:
If using one quarter wavelength, then divide 75.29 by the frequency in MHz.
If using one half wavelength, then divide 150.57 by the frequency in MHz.
If using the full wavelength, then divide 304.19 by the frequency in MHz.

2. Choose the number of turns to be used in the coil when winding it using the
wire length just calculated. The number of turns will be governed by the
diameter of the tube on which the coil is to be wound. Remember that the ratio
of the number of turns in the "L - 1" and "L - 2" coils, controls the overall output
voltage. For example, if the voltage applied the large outer coil "L - 1" is 2,400
volts and L - 1 has ten turns, then each turn of L - 1 will have 240 volts dropped
across it. This 240 volts of magnetic induction transfers 240 volts of electricity to
every turn of wire in the inner "L - 2" coil. If the diameter of L - 2 is small enough
to have 100 turns, then the voltage produced will be 24,000 volts. If the
diameter of the L - 2 former allows 500 turns, then the output voltage will be
120,000 volts.

3. Choose the length and diameter of the coils. The larger the diameter of the coil,
the fewer turns can be made with the wire length and so the coil length will be
less, and the output voltage will be lower.

4. For example, if 24.7 MHz is the desired output frequency, then the length of
wire, in feet, would be 247 divided by 24.7 which is 10 feet of wire (3,048 mm).
The coil may be wound on a standard size of PVC pipe or alternatively,
purchased from a supplier - typically, an amateur radio supply store.

If the voltage on each turn of L - 1 is arranged to be 24 volts and the desired
output voltage 640 volts, then there needs to be 640 / 24 = 26.66 turns on L - 2,
wound with the 10 feet of wire already calculated.

Note: At this point, Don's calculations go adrift and he suggests winding 30
turns on a 2-inch former. If you do that, then it will take about 16 feet of wire and
the resonant point at 10-feet will be at about 19 turns, giving an output voltage
of 458 volts instead of the required 640 volts, unless the number of turns on L -
1 is reduced to give more than 24 volts per turn. However, the actual required
diameter of the coil former (plus one diameter of the wire) is 10 x 12 / (26.67 x
3.14159) = 1.43 inches. You can make this size of former up quite easily if you
want to stay with ten turns on the L - 1 coil.

5. Connect to the start of the coil. To determine the exact resonant point on the
coil, a measurement is made. Off-the-shelf multimeters are not responsive to
high-frequency signals so a cheap neon is used instead. Holding one wire of
the neon in one hand and running the other neon wire along the outside of the L
- 2 winding, the point of brightest light is located. Then the neon is moved along
that turn to find the brightest point along that turn, and when it is located, a
connection is made to the winding at that exact point. L - 2 is now a resonant
winding. It is possible to increase the ("Q") effectiveness of the coil by
spreading the turns out a bit instead of positioning them so that each turn
touches both of the adjacent turns.

6. The input power has been suggested as 2,400 volts. This can be constructed
from a Jacob's ladder arrangement or any step-up voltage system. An off-theshelf module as used with lasers is another option.

7. Construction of the L - 1 input coil has been suggested as having 10 turns. The
length of the wire in this coil is not critical. If a 2-inch diameter PVC pipe was
used for the L - 2 coil, then the next larger size of PVC pipe can be used for the
L - 1 coil former. Cut a 10-turn length of the pipe (probably a 3-inch diameter
pipe). The pipe length will depend on the diameter of the insulated wire used to
make the winding. Use a good quality multimeter or a specialised LCR meter to
measure the capacitance (in Farads) and the inductance (in henrys) of the L - 2
coil. Now, put a capacitor for matching L - 1 to L - 2 across the voltage input of L
- 1, and a spark gap connected in parallel is required for the return voltage from
L - 1. A trimmer capacitor for L - 1 is desirable.

8. The performance of L - 2 can be further enhanced by attaching an earth
connection to the base of the coil. The maximum output voltage will be between
the ends of coil L - 2 and lesser voltages can be taken off intermediate points
along the coil if that is desirable.

Don provides quite an amount of information on one of his devices shown here:

![](assets/c0009-22.png)

Without his description of the device, it would be difficult to understand it's construction
and method of operation. Don's description appears to be for a somewhat simplified
version. As I understand it, the circuit of what is mounted on this board is as shown
here:
