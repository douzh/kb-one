TransWorld Energy is dedicated to improving the Human Condition in the Field of Energy which, at the same time, makes possible Healthy Water and increases the food Supply. A never-ending source of energy found throughout the universe is easily accessed with the minimum of effort and cost. The technology for doing this has been around since the 1820s. Selfish special interests have made sure that the technology remains discredited. People who control the Energy Sources control the World.

TransWorld Energy致力于改善能源领域的人类状况，同时使健康的水成为可能，并增加粮食供应。在整个宇宙中发现的永无止境的能源很容易以最小的努力和成本获得。这项技术自19世纪20年代以来就已经存在了。自私的特殊利益集团确保了这项技术仍然不可信。控制能源的人控制着世界。

Extensive research and development by TransWorld and Associates has been progressing for more than 15 years. Numerous successful Energy Producing Devices have been produced and demonstrated throughout the World. Some of these can be viewed by the Web Site located using any major search engine (such as Lycos, Yahoo, Altavista, NorthenLight and more than 2,000 others throughout the World).

TransWorld and Associates的广泛研究和开发已经进行了15年多。世界各地已经生产和演示了许多成功的能源生产设备。其中一些可以通过使用任何主要搜索引擎（如Lycos、Yahoo、Altavista、NorthenLight和世界各地的2000多个其他搜索引擎）定位的网站查看。

The Good News is that the problem is solved and with assistance, an ultimate source of energy which is environmentally benign, abundant throughout the universe and inexpensive to capture, is there for the taking.
