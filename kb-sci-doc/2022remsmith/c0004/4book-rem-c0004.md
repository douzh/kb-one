A deep fog pervades the entire Scientific Community with regards to the Significance of the Above Energy Sources. Magnetic Waves convert directly into Electrical Waves (useful electricity). Two sides of the electromagnetic system are always present and never separate.  Local electron spin provides (action at a distance) the flip side of the incoming magnetic wave energy.

关于上述能源的重要性，整个科学界笼罩着一层浓厚的迷雾。磁波可以直接转换成电波（有用的电能）。电磁系统的两个方面总是同时存在且不可分离。局部电子自旋提供了（远距离作用）入射磁波能量的另一面。

Enormous amounts of incoming magnetic wave energy becomes a part of the Ambient Background, and as such, cannot be measured directly. Reconstruction from indirect information, allows us to establish the actual energy levels which are present. Instruments provided by the Scientific Community measure only point "A" to "B", and when both are ambient, no potential energy is shown. This is the "bird sitting on the million volt power line and sensing nothing" approach. The Earth's actual ambient background has as it's Energy level multi-billions of Volts, which are conveniently and obliviously ignored by the scientific community. When properly understood, this enormous, never-ending source of environmentally-friendly energy becomes available.

大量的入射磁波能量成为环境背景的一部分，因此无法直接测量。通过间接信息重建，我们可以确定实际存在的能量水平。科学界提供的仪器只能测量从点“A”到点“B”的值，当两者都是环境背景时，不会显示出任何电势能。这就是“鸟儿站在百万伏特的电线上却感觉不到任何东西”的方法。地球的实际环境背景能量水平高达数十亿伏特，却被科学界方便地忽略了。一旦正确理解，这一巨大的、永不停歇的环保能源就变得可用。

## 电能系统

Electrical Energy System

Don L. Smith, Energy Consultant

At a meeting between J.P. Morgan, Edison and Tesla, Tesla proposed an Electrical Energy System which could he connected into directly, without using a meter. Tesla's Idea of "Free Energy" was not compatible with their thinking. Courtesy of Morgan and Edison, from that day foreword, a complete and total bastardization of the Idea has been in progress. Agents for Morgan and Friends include the U.S. Patent Office and Academia. Academia's bad habit of incestuous quoting of each other, eliminates them as a possibility in cleaning up the mess. This selective ignorance, permeates throughout the study of electricity

在 J.P. 摩根、爱迪生和特斯拉之间的一次会议上，特斯拉提出了一种可以直接接入的电能系统，无需使用电表。特斯拉的“免费能源”理念与他们的想法不兼容。从那天起，在摩根和爱迪生的支持下，对这一理念的彻底篡改一直在进行。摩根及其朋友的代理人包括美国专利局和学术界。学术界相互引用的陋习使他们不可能清理这一混乱局面。这种选择性忽视贯穿于整个电力研究领域。

Many people, otherwise known as "intellectuals", have a total blackout and become jabbering idiots when "free-energy" is mentioned. The term has been amended to say, "something which was never there is being harvested and that this violates the laws of physics". For the selectively ignorant, this seems the way to run. Those who choose Morgan's drum beat, have severely limited the possibilities built into electricity.

许多被称为“知识分子”的人在提到“免费能源”时会完全失去理智，变得胡言乱语。这一术语被修改为：“正在采集一些原本不存在的东西，这违反了物理定律。”对于那些选择性无知的人来说，这似乎是他们的行事方式。那些选择跟随摩根鼓点的人严重限制了电力领域的可能性。

This paper will be an exercise in creative understanding, in placing updated knowledge at your disposal. Whether it becomes a useful tool or is selectively ignored is your choice.

本文将是一次创造性理解的练习，旨在为你提供更新的知识。它是否成为一个有用的工具还是被选择性地忽略，取决于你的选择。

Electrons are defined as being the practical source of electrical and magnetic energy. The electron as a particle, was postulated by professor J. Thompson in early 1900's. It is now universally accepted that the electron exists and that it is the source of electricity. When the electron is agitated it produces magnetic and negative electrical energy. Physics as it exists today, cannot explain why the electron remains intact and is not diminished by the energy it releases. This is a part of the built-in ignorance provided by the Morgan and Edison Camp.

电子被定义为电能和磁能的实际来源。作为粒子的电子是由 J. 汤姆森教授在 20 世纪初提出的。现在普遍接受电子的存在，并认为它是电能的来源。当电子受到激发时，会产生磁能和负电能。现代物理学无法解释为什么电子在释放能量后仍然保持完整而不减少。这是摩根和爱迪生阵营带来的内置无知的一部分。

One volts worth of electrons, when cycled, yields one volts worth of electricity. This can be repeated continuously forever and it never deplete or diminishes the electrons in question. They simply return to their air and/or earth source, waiting to do the whole thing again and again.  Therefore, electrical energy is available, anywhere and everywhere humans go. People who intercede for profit, set the cost of electrical energy. Otherwise, all electrical energy is free, Morgan and Edison be damned.

一伏特的电子在循环时会产生一伏特的电能。这个过程可以无限重复，永远不会耗尽或减少这些电子。它们只是返回到空气和/或地球的来源，等待再次进行同样的过程。因此，电能在人类到达的任何地方都是可用的。为了盈利而介入的人设定了电能的成本。否则，所有的电能都是免费的，不管摩根和爱迪生怎么说。

Improving upon Professor Thompson's postulation, other obvious characteristics can be seen to further define the electron. It has both magnetic and electrical emanations resulting from a right-hand and left-hand spin. Since magnetism and amperage come as one package, this suggest, that electrons in their natural non-ionic state, exist as doublets. When pushed apart by agitation one spins and supplies electricity and the other spins and provides magnetic (amperage) energy. When they reunite, we have Volts x Amperage = Watts. This Idea, until now, has been totally absent from the knowledge base.

改进汤姆森教授的假设，可以看到电子具有其他明显的特征，从而进一步定义电子。它具有右手和左手自旋产生的磁性和电性辐射。由于磁性和电流是一体的，这表明电子在其自然非离子状态时，以双电子的形式存在。当受到激发而被推开时，一个自旋并提供电能，另一个自旋并提供磁能（电流）。当它们重新结合时，我们得到伏特 × 安培 = 瓦特。这一想法直到现在一直完全缺失于知识库中。

The number of times that an electron is cycled, sets the collective energy potential present. The electrical equivalent of $E = mC^2$ is $E = (Volts x Amperes) x (Cycles Per Second)^2$. Those who choose, are now free to head for the bushes and make their usual contribution to humanity.

电子循环的次数决定了存在的集体能量势。$E=mC^2$的电气等效值为$E=（伏特x安培）x（每秒循环数）^2$。那些选择的人现在可以自由地前往灌木丛，为人类做出他们通常的贡献。

Prior to Tesla, there was a large group of people in Europe, who were building resonant coil systems for medical use. Amperage was dangerous in their coil systems. The Tesla Coil is only the Voltage half of their coil system, as will be demonstrated. A short list of those (from 1860 onwards) active in resonate high frequency coil systems include; the Curies, Roentgen, Ruhmkoff, Oudin, Hertz, Levassor, Dumont, D'Arsonval and many others.

在特斯拉之前，欧洲有一大群人建造共振线圈系统用于医疗用途。在他们的线圈系统中，电流是危险的。特斯拉线圈只是他们线圈系统中的电压部分，这一点将会得到证明。从 1860 年开始，活跃在共振高频线圈系统领域的人物包括：居里夫妇、伦琴、鲁姆科尔夫、奥迪、赫兹、勒瓦索、杜蒙、达松瓦尔等许多人。

Peugeot, Panhard-Levassor, Bollee, Renault and others had successful electric automobiles in production using A C. motors. Various electrically-powered airships, including the Dirigible "France" were in service.

标致、潘哈德·莱瓦索尔、博利、雷诺和其他公司已经成功生产了使用交流电机的电动汽车。包括“法国”号飞船在内的各种电动飞艇正在服役。

D'Arsonval, Professor of Experimental Medicine at the College of France, invented the electrocardiograph, oscilloscope, amp and volt meters, thermography and numerous other medical applications of high frequency electricity. As early as 1860, he was building high frequency coil systems, which he used in his experimental work. There is a strong connection between the work of Tesla and the people mentioned above.

达松瓦尔是法国学院的实验医学教授，他发明了心电图仪、示波器、安培表和电压表、热成像技术以及高频电的众多其他医疗应用。早在 1860 年，他就开始建造高频线圈系统，并在实验工作中使用。特斯拉的工作与上述人物之间有着密切的联系。

Electric vehicles of all sorts, dominated until the 1920s, when the electric starter motor made the internal combustion engine practical. Prior to that, upon cranking, it frequently would break the owner's arm. At that point the use of batteries as a source of power was replaced by oil.  The establishment's carpet has some rather large lumps under it. Coulomb's and Newton's inverse square law is politely ignored and it's opposite is allowed to have only the most abstract status. Without opposites we have no definition.

各种类型的电动汽车在 20 世纪 20 年代之前占据主导地位，直到电动启动马达使内燃机变得实用。在此之前，手动启动时经常会导致车主的手臂骨折。从那时起，电池作为动力源被石油取代。既定体系的地毯下有一些相当大的疙瘩。库仑定律和牛顿的平方反比定律被礼貌地忽略，而其相反的情况只被赋予最抽象的地位。没有对立面，我们就无法定义事物。

The source value of a remote flux reading, requires the squaring of the distance, times the remote reading, to obtain the original value. The opposite of this, being the derivations relate to Energy equals Mass times the Velocity constant squared. The electrical equivalent, being Energy equal capacitance times voltage squared and Energy equals induction times amperes squared. Flux lines increase as the law of squares and then activate electron energy which was not previously a part of the sum. The cumulative capacitance and inductance increase as the outer ends of a Tesla coil are approached, and this results in output energy being greater than the input energy present. This Energy is real. It can be safely measured by magnetic flux methods and electrostatic voltmeters, based on the inverse square law

远程通量读数的源值需要将距离平方乘以远程读数，才能获得原始值。与此相反的情况与能量等于质量乘以速度常数平方的推导有关。其电气等价形式是能量等于电容乘以电压平方，以及能量等于电感乘以电流平方。通量线按照平方定律增加，然后激活之前不属于总和的电子能量。当接近特斯拉线圈的外端时，累积电容和电感随之增加，这导致输出能量大于输入能量。这种能量是真实的。基于平方反比定律，可以通过磁通量方法和静电电压表安全地测量它。

As seen above, flux lines result both from induction-henrys-amperage and capacitancecoulombs-volts, and define electrical energy. The non-linearity of this system does not obey Ohm's law, which is replaced with impedance and reactance for alternating current systems.  Impedance is the sum of the system's resistance to AC current flow, and this becomes zero at resonance. In resonant induction systems, a cycles-per-second increase, invokes a second round for the law of squares.

如上所述，通量线既来自电感-亨利-电流，也来自电容-库仑-电压，并定义了电能。这个系统的非线性不符合欧姆定律，而在交流系统中用阻抗和感抗代替。阻抗是系统对交流电流流动的总阻力，在谐振时变为零。在谐振感应系统中，每秒循环次数的增加会引发平方定律的第二轮效应。

The degree to which flux lines are present, disturbs an equal amount of electrons, upsetting the ambient background energy, resulting in useful electrical energy being obtained. The frequency at which the disturbance occurs, increases the useful energy available, and it obeys the law of squares. Two square-law components, flux density and frequency are involved. Enter resonance which cancels the resistive effect.

通量线的存在程度会扰动相同数量的电子，破坏环境背景能量，从而获得有用的电能。扰动发生的频率会增加可用的有用能量，并遵循平方定律。涉及两个平方定律成分：通量密度和频率。谐振消除了电阻效应。

Only the electrical energy which is either above or below the ambient level is useful. For the Central U.S. going east to west, ambient as approximated by electro-static voltmeters and flux methods is 200,000 volts on a solar-quiet day. At night time, the ambient energy level drops to about one half of the daytime value. On a solar-active day, it may reach more than five times that of a solar-quiet day. Ambient background energy at the polar regions, is approximately 500,000 volts on a solar-quiet day. The background energy varies as it relates to the NorthSouth component and the East-West continuum.

只有高于或低于环境水平的电能才是有用的。对于美国中部地区，从东到西，用电静电电压表和通量方法近似测量，在太阳平静的日子里，环境电能约为 200,000 伏特。在夜间，环境能量水平降至白天值的一半左右。在太阳活动的日子里，它可能会达到太阳平静日子的五倍以上。在极地地区，在太阳平静的日子里，背景环境能量约为 500,000 伏特。背景能量的变化与南北分量和东西连续体有关。

This leaves us with an interesting problem. Electrons, when disturbed, first produce magnetic flux and then produce electrical flux when they spin back to their normal position. Therefore any electron movement produces above ambient energy, being over unity.

这给我们留下了一个有趣的问题。当电子受到扰动时，首先会产生磁通量，然后在它们旋转回到正常位置时产生电通量。因此，任何电子运动都会产生高于环境的能量，即超过一倍的能效。
